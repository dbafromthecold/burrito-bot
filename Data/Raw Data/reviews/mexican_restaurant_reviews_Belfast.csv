I highly recommend the Birria beef tacos and the papitas fritas. The pulled beef paired with the crunchy shells and flavourful bone broth is a perfect combination.

As I am lactose intolerant the option of the vegan cheese on the tacos and the vegan version of the papitas fritas made my experience even better.

The Mezcal margaritas deserve a special mention as they are divine!

I would highly recommend this place. It has become a favourite of ours.","Don’t be fooled by the understated front of this restaurant, inside is a place bursting with a vibrant atmosphere and delicious food!

Both me and my wife opted for quesadillas as Tacos were unfortunately out of stock,  being my wife's first time trying this style of food, she was slightly disappointed, but when our meals arrived, she was very pleased with the flavours!

Staff were very friendly, a great atmosphere when you walk in the door and doesn't feel like a chain restaurant but doesn't feel like a small corner venue either.

Seating was a bit short on it, so we decided to sit outside considering it was a nice day and there are always some buskers in the square to provide entertainment.

Nicola deserves her own review. She was over the top in the best possible way full birthday energy, top-tier service, and genuinely made the night feel special. You can tell she actually cares, which is rare these days.

Brought the family along and every single one of them loved it (miracles do happen). Food was unreal , service was elite, vibes were spot on.

The food was amazing, fresh, and full of flavour. What really stood out though was the service — especially from one staff member (an Indian guy with glasses). He was super friendly and helpful, took the time to explain how everything works since it was our first time, and even gave us a few meat samples to try before choosing. He suggested combos based on our spice tolerance and flavour preferences, which made a big difference. Even though it was a bit busy, he never rushed us and seemed genuinely happy to help. Massive shoutout to him — he made the visit 10x better. Definitely coming back!","First time at Boojum on Great Victoria Street and honestly, such a great experience!

When it came to actually getting my extra rice the skinnier guy pointed to it and said “you won’t get much more in that mate” basically saying no extra, which just made things extremely awkward and most people would just drop it there but when you’re charging 13 quid for a burrito bowl you can bet that I will get what I’m paying for.

When we arrived, there was a queue outside and it took over half an hour to get a table. It was absolutely freezing. I don’t usually wait in queues — that’s a big no for me — but we were already there, so we waited.

And it paid off.

Once inside, the place was warm and cozy, which felt incredible after standing in the cold. We ordered two cappuccinos, and they were excellent — properly hot and really well made.

My husband ordered the fried chicken waffle, and I had the sourdough with mushrooms and two poached eggs, plus two beef sausages on the side. That was a standout for me. You rarely see beef sausages offered; it’s almost always pork or vegetarian, and I don’t eat pork, so this was a big win.

Our daughter had French toast with honey and raspberry jam, and we also ordered her a hot chocolate (not pictured). Everything we ordered was excellent. The flavors were incredible and the portions were massive.

The bill came to around £50, and it matched the experience. The food lived up to the hype. One thing to note: the space is a little cramped, and the tables are quite close together.

Overall, a very strong spot. We will definitely be coming back again 🙌🏼🤩","This place has been on my list for a while, and we finally made it.

Large portions and helpful and friendly staff. Made the rookie mistake of calling ‘nacho chips’ Chips in Ireland 😱 here chips are potato fries!!!  So instead of nachos and guacamole we got fries and guacamole 🤔😕 wee bit disappointing. The beans and Mexican bowl was a generous portion and with  great flavours. There salsa is not vegetarian/ vegan which is surprisingly so ( why add meat in everything) wish they would add vegan cheeses to their menu as the enchiladas we got was without any cheeses. Would definitely come back again if in the area.
Great value for money. Lovely vibrant decor. Came back so hungry that we forgot to take pictures of the food😋","Glad to find vegan vegetarian options. Large portions and helpful and friendly staff.

Order was over 50 minutes late at this point, Deliveroo wouldn’t allow us to cancel the order we were convinced the restaurant had forgotten the order because when we called to chase it up the phone was continuously disconnected. They have their own in house drivers so Deliveroo couldn’t even get an update for us either. Eventually after 55 minutes of waiting we decided to drive over to the store to enquire and received a call five minutes after leaving from flatmate letting us know the food had arrived. After the wait I could say the food was disappointing and I’d be underestimating how bad it was. The tacos were completely inedible as the shell had disintegrated from being in the box so long. Chips were wet and soggy. Everything was stone cold. Worst take away I think I’ve had and such a waste of almost £30.

We had the vegan meatball pizza and built our own, adding the vegan pepperoni for protein. I would say the meatballs are stand out and super flavourful, so would advise anyone to try them out first. I enjoyed the vegan pepperoni but the meatballs were a tough act to follow! The vegan cheese is also really enjoyable, striking a good balance between consistency and strength. I also love the dough as it is not very greasy or too thick.
Overall I would say the pizza is very tasty and for vegans you have some strong options to keep you coming back. My only criticism would be around service times, it seems like they need more staff or maybe even an app. This would help to get things moving quickly. For example our food came out before our drinks, which shows there is a disconnect somewhere in the process!

Luckily we walked right up and got served by the most hospitable guy with a beard. When I told him I had never been before, he kindly talked me through how it all worked, what each dish was and made us feel very welcome. He also offered to exchange any food order we didn't like, which was a really nice touch for customer service. Honestly, it was a short but sweet interaction that made us feel welcome and appreciated - this makes all the difference in the world.

Of course we did not need to exchange any slices we ordered as they were all absolutely incredible. The pepperoni and Vodka Sausage were both fantastic. Would highly recommend both. My son had a classic slice of Margherita and he ate most of it without complaint (was slightly too big for him, but I gladly helped him finish the portion).

Will 100% come back on account of both food and service. As it is a bit more expensive than its competitors, the service really tipped the scales on whether or not I'd return. The pizza is top quality, but it's the service that made the whole thing exceptional.","So, I went here with my wife and 3 year old son on a whim knowing it's always busy, with no expectations of getting in.

Will 100% come back on account of both food and service. As it is a bit more expensive than its competitors, the service really tipped the scales on whether or not I'd return. The pizza is top quality, but it's the service that made the whole thing exceptional.","https://www.google.com/maps/reviews/data=!4m6!14m5!1m4!2m3!1sChZDSUhNMG9nS0VLcTkwcVBuNUxXNmVnEAE!2m1!1s0x486109211037e07b:0x137bfe653f842ec7"

It wasn't our first choices, but we wanted a good night out, and Revolutión de Cuba looked good - on paper.

The atmosphere was lively, any other night, it would be perfect. Unfortunately, it wasn't ideal for us; far too loud, so loud we couldn't hear what the person, who was sitting next to us, was saying. Usually on a 'work's night out', the ambient music is lower during meal times. I understand this is more of a club scene, and if we were just going to use it as such, it would be fine, and my ratings would reflect this, but as a Christmas meal venue, it did not work for us at this time.

The food came out promptly, as we had pre-ordered that was to be expected, my starter was nice, except I wasn't expecting hot chilli peppers on my prawn cocktail. I suppose that was a Mexican twist on a Christmas classic! My slow cooked beef was chewy and not very warm, but my pudding - banana Eton Mess - was delicious! For the price, I would've expected better.

All in all, as a Christmas meal venue, it did not work. As just a Christmas drinks night out, it would've been ok.","We came here for our work's Christmas 'do'. It wasn't our first choices, but we wanted a good night out, and Revolutión de Cuba looked good - on paper.

Turns out I'm OK at it, although I am going to say that was down to the very welcoming and supportive host Claire. She guided us all through the various breads.

We made 4 different loaves as well as 2 batches of Pizza dough each. Each person was able to make there own individual pizza, shown how to roll out the base and encouraged to load that bad boy up with as many toppings as we'd like. We each then sat and ate our beautiful pizza and sipped on a glass a wine to finish the session.

I can honestly say it was good fun and I learned a lot. I will definitely go back and do another masterclass. The list of classes available varied.

They also offer many more Filipino dishes that showcase the comfort and authenticity of our cuisine. I am excited to come back and try the rest of their menu because I really miss the taste of real Filipino food.

The place is very neat with a warm and welcoming ambiance. The decorations and overall setup make you feel relaxed and comfortable while dining. You can see the love and effort put into creating a place where Filipinos and locals alike can enjoy good food and good vibes.

My friend and I went at lunchtime for takeaway and were served immediately by a very pleasant member of staff. The music in the shop when we arrived was very loud, but a member of staff must have thought so too, and quickly turned it down a bit. I ordered the Reuben with pastrami, cheese, pickles, sauerkraut and mustard, and my friend ordered the Mexican chicken on a wrap. We waited less than 10 minutes until our order was ready, and we were able to pay separately using both cash and card payments.

Now, onto the sandwich itself. I personally didn't feel that it was worth £12 for the size of my Reuben, and at £11, my friends' wrap was even smaller still. My foccacia was quite dry, and I'd have loved either a dipping sauce or even a little bit of mayo in addition to the mustard. There was SO much sauerkraut that I couldn't taste the cheese at all. I love sauerkraut and pickles in general, but to have so much on there that it overpowered everything else was really disappointing. The flavour profile was just really unbalanced for my taste, though the pastrami when I tried it by itself, was thinly sliced and super tasty.

Now, onto the reason for the low rating. Most deli's will wrap a sandwich in paper, slice it in half, and THEN wrap it in foil. At Stran-wiches, they wrap it in the paper and foil and then slice it which means that when I went to eat my Reuben, I kept finding tiny bits of foil throughout the first few bites closest to where it had been cut. I found this really off-putting because it effectively forced me to use my fingers to dig through my sandwich to remove them, which on an airated bread like foccacia wasn't easy!! Such a silly mistake to make, but it significantly affected my enjoyment of my lunch, and my first impression of this place.

My friends opinion of her Mexican Chicken wrap was that everything was fresh and the texture of the wrap was so pleasant, but the sauce was so overpowering that it was all she could taste. After eating her wrap, she was still a bit hungry too, which after spending £11 definitely shouldn't be the case.

Overall, I'd probably go back to Stran-wiches and maybe try one of the salad bowls next time but I think, especially on Stranmillis where you have really class places to choose from for lunchtime offerings, it would be way lower down on my list.","First time trying Stran-wiches today.

My friends opinion of her Mexican Chicken wrap was that everything was fresh and the texture of the wrap was so pleasant, but the sauce was so overpowering that it was all she could taste. After eating her wrap, she was still a bit hungry too, which after spending £11 definitely shouldn't be the case.

Overall, I'd probably go back to Stran-wiches and maybe try one of the salad bowls next time but I think, especially on Stranmillis where you have really class places to choose from for lunchtime offerings, it would be way lower down on my list.","https://www.google.com/maps/reviews/data=!4m6!14m5!1m4!2m3!1sChdDSUhNMG9nS0VMU2I0NTMxLWF2Nmd3RRAB!2m1!1s0x4861092f4502cd25:0x7f894c23db49101b"

My favourite will always be the turkey sandwich with pear slices, it sounds weird but it is the perfect combination. I think their sandwich ideas are original and cater towards everyone. As everything is fresh to order and there is always a line you can be waiting for around 15 minutes which seems like a long wait but gives you time to go next door for some traybakes or across the street to the shop and I would say the wait is worth it because the sandwiches are huge and have sometimes done me for lunch and dinner on the day.","I’ve been to stranwiches a good number of times and I have loved it every time.

The staff were very friendly and helpful from the moment we walked in, and they gave us good recommendations, which made a great first impression.
We ordered the bao bun set, the wings meal, and a half-and-half meal with fries, rice, and crispy chicken. Each set also comes with a drink, which is definitely a nice bonus. The portions are quite generous – one meal is more than enough to feel full and satisfied. As for the taste, everything was absolutely delicious: fresh ingredients, well-seasoned meat, and a great balance of flavours.
The restaurant is located on the ground floor, so it’s easy to access with a stroller. There is seating available inside, and a few tables outside as well, which is perfect if the weather is good.

Customer service is just as important as food quality, especially when welcoming new guests—and sadly, this visit fell short on both fronts.

Food was excellent and was brought out quickly. Service initially was a tad slow but not enough to hinder the experience. The area we were in for food was quiet enough but definitely seemed like a lot of life in the next room (maybe the main bar area?)

Anywho, would highly recommend for a feed. We got 2 courses for £19 each on a Saturday night and was very happy with that.

Fish was absolutely fantastic and a great homemade curry to go along with it. Salt and chilli beef to start was great too, not chewy at all and full of flavour.

The burger was good and plenty of sauce for those that like it saucy. Overall - a good burger!

The real star here was the loaded fries though, wow, amazing. The curry sauce was just like what you’d get from a Chinese and there was just the right amount of chilli’s, spring onions etc on top. Bursting with flavour and the perfect amount of spice.

My good friend aayush has been ranting and raving about this place, to be honest he always smells really yummy. Like curry. I hypothesised this was because of the food here. However he must just be taking curry baths because the food did not taste nearly as good as he smells. I did however enjoy the abundance of bossman’s toenails in my food. Will be back to stalk handsome brown boys.","As a half and half Chinese Mexican immigrant myself this fusion between Chinese and Mexican food was right up my street!
