My gosh it was fantastic! I had to tell the chef personally.

My favourite was actually the soft corn tortillas; amazing flavour and incredibly fresh. Little tostados (like nachos) of different colours were great too. I asked for mine to be spicy and it was a little hot, not too crazy. Very morish.

My mate got the mole and it was tasty. Both meals presented really lovely.

Our serving staff was really friendly too.

My slight criticisms: my fork was a bit dirty still, and the restaurant was a little cold (other diners also noted this).

I hope to be back soon!!","Midweek lunch and I ordered vegetarian fajitas (vegan friendly). My gosh it was fantastic! I had to tell the chef personally.

This used to be one of our favourite places to catch up, but the experience this time was poor from start to finish.

Even though we had a reservation and arrived early, we still waited about past our booking time to be seated. Partway through our meal we were asked to move our table backwards so a band could set up behind us, even though they did not start playing until right before we left. The music in the restaurant was already very loud, and the setup happening directly behind us made it extremely difficult to have a normal conversation.

Service was slow all evening. There were long delays between dishes, and it was difficult to get anyone’s attention even to order drinks. My mixed meat fajitas cost 24 euro and were disappointing. The chicken portion was very disappointing size wise, and the steak was undercooked. I was not asked how I wanted it cooked, and the staff seemed far too busy to address it.

What made this even more frustrating is that I emailed the restaurant privately on the 21st to share this feedback and never received a reply.

The Marina Market is better for food quality & more food options, but The Black Market is better to go & chill with nice coffee.

Food is incredible, with this place being so popular, you are always getting the freshest possible ingredients as they sell so fast and they need to keep topping up. Everything from the rice to the lime juice, prepared in store. Staff are extremely friendly and well trained, sometimes I even wonder if they are trained in conversation with customers as I always seem to walk away from the till with a smile on my face. I have also noticed that they change gloves between each customer, which proves the level of cleanliness and quality within the kitchen. I have experienced the burritos from each staff member and I have to say, the consistency is unbelievable. Either the manager has hit the jackpot with staff or learned how to correctly manage people ( a very rare skill these days ).

A tablespoon of guacamole cost an extra €1.40 so it cost €7.90 in total for the tiniest portion that wouldn’t even be sufficient for a small child. Didn’t even taste good to make up for the extortionate cost and tiny portion size. Food was not put on a tray or anything for dining in. Was still hungry after it. Absolute joke. Definitely would not go back.

Edit: Hey Jessica, well done on completely refusing to acknowledge my complaint as a whole and refusing any accountability for the experience. The Nachos were listed in the following sizes ""Small, Medium and Large"". There is no ""mini"" option. In regards to your nachos being sourced from Tipperary, do you mean the chips? If so, I'm afraid I can't comment on how good they were since there was so few of them, but well done on taking credit for someone else's product.

They managed to fit us in without reservation (on a shared table)

Service:
Man with the big beard was excellent, provided great recommendations and was friendly throughout.

Food:

The small plate pork belly was incredible! It literally blew us away with the flavours!!! 5/5

We got two shared plates:
1. Peruvian fried chicken
Slightly salty but had good flavours. Rice was tasty, probably the best part of the dish. All in all, it didn’t wow us. 3/5

2. Seared Prawns
A unique dish, the prawns come cold with carrots, onions and even strawberries!
The broth had lots of flavour however, we weren’t too impressed with the prawns. 3/5

Dessert: Flan de Coco
Underwhelming, didn’t taste of much. Highlight is the honeycomb.

Atmosphere:
Small and cosy vibe.
Music was a tad bit too loud, couldn’t converse that well.
Cool Latin American theme throughout the restaurant.
Toilets were spotless.","Arrived around 8pm on a busy Saturday night. They managed to fit us in without reservation (on a shared table)

We hadn't booked so got a small bar stool table which was still comfortable. We ordered 5 of small plates and the pork tacos to share.
My cocktail was incredible and well explained by the server who was enthusiastic, friendly and well versed.
The market fish tostadas were our stand out dish, but the rest of the dishes were also very good. My only slight criticism would be that I wanted a little more spice - but that's personal preference!

Really enjoyable and highly recommend! We might be back!","Everything about this spot was perfect!

My salad was fresh and tasty! Nice chunks of avocado too.

My chicken supreme was SO SO GOOD! I normally don’t eat cauliflower so I gave it a taste tonight and ended up eating it. That goes to show on how well prepared everything was right down to the cauliflower.

Unfortunately, the experience left a lot to be desired. There was no one to greet me when I arrived, and I stood waiting for about five minutes before another guest kindly informed me I should just seat myself. I wasn’t given a menu and had to go to the bar to ask for one.

Service was very slow — it took a while for anyone to take my drink and food order. I ordered the pork belly and waited around 45 minutes before checking in, only to be told there had been delays due to a fire drill earlier that affected the gas supply. This hadn’t been mentioned when I ordered.

When the food arrived (after about an hour), it was just okay. The pork belly was unfortunately overcooked and quite dry. I had originally planned to stay for dessert, but decided it wasn’t worth the extra time.

At entrance, no one was there to seat us so we had to find our own seats. We waited around 15 minutes to even receive menus, even that we had to call a second waitress over to get them as the first one we called over never ended up giving them to us even though she said she would. The food was acceptable, but the service did not create a pleasant or enjoyable atmosphere. We later received our food and waited an extra 10 minutes whilst eating to receive our drinks. I also received the worst pint of coors I have ever seen in my entire life, the head on the pint was paper thin and the pint overall tasted funny. The bartender agreed with me that the pint did not look right but didn’t offer me a new one just topped up the head on the same pint instead. When we finished our meal, I stood up as no one was coming to us to offer us a dessert menu and walked to the entrance where there was a waitress. I asked her for the dessert menu and she then begged me to sit down and said she would bring one to me. At the end of the night the waitress handed me the bill and asked me to please check the bill? I have never been asked this before, as expected the bill was wrong and I was being charged for items I did not order. She then reprinted the bill and asked me to check it once again. When I confronted one of the staff for the unacceptable waiting time she told me to “maybe book tomorrow instead”. This was not a great experience and I am very disappointed in the restaurant and its staff as the restaurant was not busy at all and I would not be recommending this restaurant to anyone I know.","The service in this restaurant tonight was appalling.

Eager to experience a taste of the local culture, I decided to stop in for a refreshing drink. From the moment I entered, the barmaid (server) greeted me with genuine warmth, kindness, and a helpful attitude.

Taking note of my curiosity, she attentively listened to my preferences and offered a wonderful suggestion: Irish apple cider. It happened to be my first time trying cider, and I'm delighted to say it was a delightful choice. The cider was perfectly crafted, striking a harmonious balance between sweetness and crispness that left me longing for another sip.

The pub itself exuded a friendly and inviting atmosphere. Although the bustling bar area was occupied, the cozy coaches offered a serene spot for me to unwind and savor my drink. Immersed in the authentic Irish ambiance, I couldn't help but appreciate the genuine sense of camaraderie and enjoyment that permeated the air.

This impromptu visit to the Irish pub left a lasting impression on me. The attentive and amiable service provided by the barmaid, along with the exceptional Irish apple cider, contributed to a truly memorable experience. I relished every moment, immersing myself in the rich tapestry of Irish tradition and hospitality.

If you find yourself exploring the Port of Cork, I wholeheartedly recommend paying a visit to this charming pub. Whether you're a cider aficionado or simply seeking a genuine taste of Ireland, you'll be treated to a warm welcome, an inviting atmosphere, and a drink that will transport you to good places.","During my stroll through the charming Port of Cork, I stumbled upon a quaint Irish pub that beckoned me inside.

Crispy, perfectly cooked fish and chips that were as fresh as it gets. The shop was spotless, and even though we came in late in the evening with a group of 11 people, Antonio handled everything with ease, patience, and a smile.

Before we stopped in, our group was frustrated from a late night issue with our accommodations. Antonio immediately stepped in, took care of us, and completely saved the day from turning into a horrible travel experience. We enjoyed the amazing fish and chips over a pint or two of amazing Guinness across the street.

It’s rare to find someone who puts this much heart into both the food and the people. His genuine hospitality turned a stressful night into one of the highlights of our trip. If every business owner was like him, the world would be a better place.","The food here is outstanding! Crispy, perfectly cooked fish and chips that were as fresh as it gets.

Spacious seating inside for dinning as takeaways go. The few extra chips added in were welcomed, which is a Irish tradition here in Ireland almost balanced the meal. As for the service there was no que only one or two people waiting and the service was spot on. The food served quickly and presented was fresh and delicious and served surprisingly quick.

I’ve been ordering from Casey’s for around 10 years and always enjoyed the Philly Steak pita. I used to get it fairly often over the years, and it was always great.

I hadn’t ordered anything for about a year, but in the last two months I started visiting Casey’s again. I ordered the Philly Steak pita three times — and each time, the quality of the beef was really bad. Yesterday’s order was the worst.

The beef was cheap, full of fatty bits, no taste, tough to chew — just horrible. It’s definitely not the same as it used to be. I don’t know what happened, but the quality has gone way down, and I’m really disappointed. My son did get a pita recently, I think with curry sauce, and he really enjoyed it — so not everything is bad. But the Philly Steak pita definitely needs attention. I hope the quality improves, because it used to be one of the best.","Very Disappointed – Philly Steak Pita Quality Is Now Horrible

It is definitely worth the drive to Douglas to go stand in the queue down the street from their door way! Their pittas are really worth it!

Staff:
The staff are very friendly here. They are also very attentive and get the order right everytime no matter how big your order is.

Food:
They have so many choices to choose from here with their Pittas being the main items that they are known for!
Some of their best pittas in my own opinion are the King Creole (Chicken), the Philly Steak (Beef) and my personal favourites the Angry Spaniard (Chicken & Chorizo) and the Kansas City Pitta (Pork).
The Angry Spaniard is a hot Pitta filled Chips, Mayo, Lettuce and topped off with Chorizo, Chicken and hot sauce!
Then the Kansas City Pitta is a hot Pitta filled with Chips, Mayo, Lettuce, sliced gherkin and topped off with slow roasted pork belly that is rubbed with their own blend of spices and coated in a homemade BBQ sauce!
Whats not to love!
They also serve really tasty burgers and they have the world of side options. These range from chips to Pineapple Fritters to their famous Chicken Bombays.
They have these huge bags too if you order a lot of food or if you need to carry your option in one bag. Handy to bring it on a picnic.

Queue:
Don't be phased by the queue here as sometimes it could be 10 people long and just inside the premises or 30 people deep outsode of the premises!
It does move fast and you won't be waiting any longer than 30 minutes to get inside to make your order.

Layout:
The new layout is much more efficient and it goes as follows: You walk up one side of the queuing area inside the premesis and at the top of this side you place your order, then turn at the top and you walk back down the other side towards the doorway and they will have your order prepaired and ready for collection juat as you go out the door!

Overall Recommendation:
I highly recommend calling to KC & Son & Sons as its a Cork staple! I always find myself here every couple of weeks and I nearly always find myself going for something different to what I ordered last time!","KC & Son & Sons is a Cork staple!

Security officer didn't let my friend in and saying he is intoxicated which isn't true. He hasn't been drinking that night at all. When I asked him what the reason is he was like in my opinion he is drunk I said he isn't drunk and he was like he is drunk in my opinion I believe he repeated that 10 times at least. I asked him to call his manager and his answer was there's no manager I figured out after he was the one who is in charge and we believe he just doesn't let people in who didn't like. We believe that because it's the only reason we can think about. This happened on 12th October approximately 1am. I don't recommend this please at all with all respect

Definitely planning to come back again—there are so many more options on the menu, and if these dishes are anything to go by, I’m sure it won’t disappoint.

That was not the case here.

Food 3/5
The seafood chowder was somewhat flavorful and contained a good amount of seafood, but the seafood itself was unfortunately overcooked, giving it a texture similar to canned chowder. It was served with bread that was extremely dry and disappointing.
The other disappointment was the carrot soup. Also, served with a dry piece of bread, the soup lacked in flavor of any sort.

In contrast the burger and the fish and chips were both tasty well portioned.

Service 3/5
For a non busy time I would have expected that we would have had more attentive service. But the real dinger here was that servers could be seen hanging about the dining area chatting with each other and one of them was even picking their teeth (with their fingers) in plain view of customers.

The atmosphere is the winner.

The Staff:
The staff are very friendly and they keep the premises spotlessly clean. So much so we thought that they had already prepped to close down for the night however, they were still open for another hour.

The Food:
They have a standard chipper menu consisting of various types of burgers, pizzas and chips.
We ordered the Hawaiian burger and chips with some curry dip on the side.
The Hawaiian burger was fantastic! They add a rasher and a slice of pineapple along with cheese and their house sauce! To be honest I don't think I can order anything else now that I've tried it it was so good!
The chips are chunky and freshly cooked to order and their curry sauce was delicious. I already know that I'll be coming back!

Layout:
Its a standard chipper with the main counter and ordering area infront of you when you walk in.
The order counter and till are to the left and glass hot lamp is to the right of the counter.
There is no seating so you can't sit down to eat however, there once had for good.

Note:
The only thing I didn't like is that when I asked for a curry chip and for the curry to be on the side they charged an extra euro than the price on the board.
It was charged as a regular chip at €3 plus a side of curry at €2, where as the ""curry chip"" on the board is €4 (I assume the curry is poured over the chips).
Its no big deal as I can undersand from a business point of view they need to cover the cost of the tub.

Overall Opinion:
If you are in the area of where the Old Youghal Road meets the Ballyhooly Road and looking for a good quality chipper I highly recommend stopping by Buns & Dough!
Next time I plan on trying their Curry Cheese Chip and I will be definitely getting the Hawaiian burger again!

The food was absolutely delicious—piping hot, flavorful, and served flawlessly, even for such a large group. Every course was a hit with our guests, and it's clear that the kitchen takes pride in the quality and presentation of each dish.

Noel was incredibly accommodating, communicating with us well in advance of our arrival to ensure everything was perfect. His professionalism and friendly demeanor made planning a breeze, and it truly showed in the seamless execution of the event.

The restaurant itself is in a fantastic location right on the seafront in Cobh, making it an ideal spot whether you're stopping by with family or hosting a business event. We can't recommend it highly enough!

For dessert, he had either a brownie or a chocolate cake (can’t remember exactly 😅) and I ordered the crème brûlée but he ended up stealing most of mine! Both desserts were fantastic.

We didn’t have a booking, but the manager was lovely and still managed to fit us in despite how busy the restaurant was on a Monday night. We shared a bottle of wine and finished the night with espresso.

The best part? The bill for two mains, two desserts, wine, and coffee didn’t even reach €100 incredible value for the quality and experience.

It is definitely very popular for the price of €9.90 as I seen staff going back and forth to different tables with this meal. I would of going with the Chicken for €18 euros but for such a pricey chicken it do not come with a few chips. If chips was added to that menu item and other menu items they would definitely sell a lot more from the menu.

The pulled pork and chips were very tasty and filling definitely worth the price. Cooked well. The service from the staff was excellent checking to see if all was ok. The girl that took the order was very nice and very helpful with explaining the menu.

The Mardyke Entertainment Venue is very large as it has a large snooker and pool section. It has bowling lanes and there is an open air rooftop area. Downstairs more seating for large groups for food and dinning.

Also another small bar with arcade games called the Barcadia. The main downstairs pub has  plenty of screens with lots of choices to watch different sports. This entertainment venue has it all.

Great staff great service and great food.

Would just add that if the meals came with chips as standard the meals would definitely be value for money and add more variety and would sell more.","Visited the Wool Shed Bar and Grill and they have a nice menu I went with the Chips and Pulled Pork simply because it was the only meal on the menu that came with chips.

I would of going with the Chicken for €18 euros but for such a pricey chicken it do not come with a few chips. If chips was added to that menu item and other menu items they would definitely sell a lot more from the menu.

The pulled pork and chips were very tasty and filling definitely worth the price. Cooked well. The service from the staff was excellent checking to see if all was ok. The girl that took the order was very nice and very helpful with explaining the menu.

The Mardyke Entertainment Venue is very large as it has a large snooker and pool section. It has bowling lanes and there is an open air rooftop area. Downstairs more seating for large groups for food and dinning.

Also another small bar with arcade games called the Barcadia. The main downstairs pub has  plenty of screens with lots of choices to watch different sports. This entertainment venue has it all.

Great staff great service and great food.

It should be noted that this whole venue is 21+ ALL DAY on Saturday (also Friday I believe) but they make exceptions to families.

So I think that needs to be looked at . Receptionist was very lovely do and when we collected our bags she wished my son a happy birthday and dropped up a sweet treat which was the highlight of our stay ! The pools fab and clean and staff there are so lovely too .
Breakfast was surprisingly delicious ( we were affraid after reading reviews ) but we couldn’t fault it and staff were nice too !
The worst part was the room it was to y and internal , the window looked down to the lobby it felt so claustrophobic and with no fan in the bathroom and aircon it was so stuffy ! The rooms very basic and needs some extra touch’s and a deep clean !
I understand the hotel needs to use all rooms but I believe more transparency is needed for these rooms , the last time we stayed we had a fabulous sea view and it was the deluxe double room we booked then too .
Perhaps offer a discounted room rate for these internal rooms so people can decide when their booking as I feel I paid quite a high rate for this shoebox which I’m sad to say has turned me off booking the hotel again !
Also the area has gotten very bad around the hotel I know this is out of your control just feel I should mention it I wouldn’t be comfortable to stay with my kids there again either !","My son and I stayed here for his birthday , he picked it out as the location suited and it has a pool .
