From the moment you walk in, the atmosphere, the music, the smells, the sounds, and the people make it feel absolutely mesmerizing.

Looking at the menu, I genuinely felt like I was back in Mexico. Every dish was bursting with flavor—tasty, fresh, and authentic. The guacamole was incredible, and the cocktail was spot on.

While I was there, I noticed two birthday parties being celebrated, and the staff were just amazing—so happy, welcoming, and full of energy. You can tell they really enjoy what they do.

It’s not a massive restaurant, but maybe that’s what makes it so special. It’s a hidden gem. If you want real Mexican food and the feeling of being in Mexico without leaving town, you need to visit this place.

First off, the portion sizes. Keep in mind I came in the morning, so it's not busy and everything is fully stocked and ready.

I'm not joking when I say I got an actual teaspoon worth of pinto beans and maybe 2 tablespoons of rice on my burrito. I was immediately wondering where on earth the rest of my burrito was.

Next came the meat. Reasonably sized scoop of pork, but given how little rice and beans I got, I asked if I could get a little bit more pulled pork, to which I was told very bluntly I have to pay for that.

At least they were generous with the vegetables, but the very limited selection kind of threw me off - normally any burrito place I go to have twice the amount of options.

Then, the burrito itself. It really wasn't great. The rice and beans were essentially imperceptible, the pork was drenched in a horrendously sweet and artificial-tasting barbaque sauce (yet somehow the meat was still dry), and the overwhelming majority of the wrap was vegetables. Now granted, I got all the veg options on it (of which there are about 4) but ONLY because of how little rice and beans I was given.

The vegetables, like the pork, were also all horrifically sweet. I seriously think they must coat them with sugar.

The wrap was only very lightly warmed, so by the time I sat down and took a bite of the burrito, it was lukewarm at best.

To add to the underwhelming experience, my girlfriend's order of loaded nachos was a similar ordeal. Very light on all the ingredients, even the nachos themselves!  She had been to other Zambreros and gotten the same thing before, and said she had never had a plate that bare.

To top it all off, the issues with the staff. The lady who served us (one of the two there, although one was just on his laptop in the eating area) kept staring over at myself and my girlfriend and hiding when we looked over. She was also coughing all over the work area in the back without covering her mouth, and I assume that's the area where the food is prepared, making it even more disgusting and unhygienic.

Very disappointed with this place. I was expecting good things since it's located in such a affluent area. Real shame, since this has now put me off from visiting any other Zambreros in the future.","Came in with high expectations and left very disappointed.

Everything was cooked to perfection, I'm usually a picky eater but I had some of everything — probably spurred on by the price I'd paid 😉 — and enjoyed it all! My date (who is Mexican) was similarly impressed with the food!
The beef was juicy and flavourful, the assorted bits on the plate were each well done and paired nicely with it, the fried potatoes were crispy on the outside and perfectly softened inside, and the corn (elotes) was okay — the smoky flavour was nice on it but there wasn't much to bite into (kernels didn't go very deep)
I had a house ginger beer and she had a pinky tuscadero, both tasted good!
There weren't any tables for two, so we were sat at the bar which was a little disappointing.
The decoration in the indoor dining area was fun and pretty authentic.
For me the music was playing just a little bit loud so it wasn't great for conversation, something the staff/management might review given that it was a Tuesday night and not a weekend.
All in all still a great experience and would go again with more people if the music was a little quieter.

The bowl as you can see in the photo is way smaller than any of the bowls of other competitors in Dublin, and the price is the same/higher.

So for the already small bowl with a bit of extra meat +cheese + guacamole I paid 14 euro!!! Sorry but this is extremely expensive for what you get.

Another tip to the management team. Use bigger bowls also so that people can mix the different ingredients together, because now this is impossible to do that without spilling everything out of the bowl.","Taste is good, but it is extremely pricy.

If you’re craving a huge, satisfying, and flavour-packed Mexican feed in Dublin, Boojum on Abbey Street is essentially a local institution. It's the king of fast-casual Mexican food, giving you massive portions that are fantastic value for money. 🌯👑

The setup is classic assembly-line style, but the ingredients are far from standard fast food. Everything is made *fresh* daily—from the slow-cooked meats (the carnitas and chipotle chicken are customer favourites!) to the vibrant, punchy salsas. They even offer a terrifying-sounding but beloved **Naga salsa** for the truly brave. 🔥🌶️

The Highlights (The Feast):

* Size Matters: The burritos here are legendary. They are giant, tightly wrapped cylinders of Mexican rice, meat, beans, and fillings. You'll likely need to use a fork by the time you're halfway through, and you definitely won't be hungry afterwards. 💚
* Customization Heaven: You are the master chef here. You choose everything: burrito, bowl, or tacos; black or pinto beans; all the fresh toppings and salsas. This makes it a great spot for vegans and vegetarians too, with options like Vegan Chilli Beans and Pork Imitator fillings. 🥑🥦
* The Vibe: It’s centrally located right near O'Connell Street, so it's always buzzing with shoppers, students (hello, student discount!), and office workers. It’s loud, quick, and efficient—perfect for a satisfying lunch or a post-pub dinner.

While the service style is fast and occasional reports mention minor mix-ups (especially with delivery), the quality and sheer volume of the food keep people lining up. It’s a reliable, delicious, and budget-friendly win! 🙏🏻🕯✝️🇻🇦🕊

I will admit I have a bias for Mexican food. It’s hard for me to leave with a bad taste in my mouth but this place is so good.

We unfortunately ate all the nachos and jalapeño poppers before I remembered to take a pic and started on the tacos too but it was so good.

The nachos we got the full portion and they’re big. I would’ve liked a bit more guac and pico de gallo but other than that very generous. Full of flavour. Even the tortilla chips you could see were covered in flavour. The guac and sour cream were super fresh as well as the pico de Gallo.

The jalapeño peppers were the best I’ve had so far. Most places do it wrong and get the jalapeño ruined or leave the skin but no spice or lack cheese or come soggy but these were served on top of a chipotle sauce I think and still were crispy. The cheese was delicious though I could’ve used a little more and the sauce was really nice with the jalapeño. Worked to cool your mouth a little.

The tacos were so good. I would’ve liked some more veg with them like pico de gallo cause they were protein heavy but the flavour was amazing. The sauce they came with was so good too. It was a smoky tomato flavour and I nearly would’ve drank it. They were so worth it.

Considering all we got the price wasn’t bad bar the drinks, €4 for small soft drinks is a rip. The staff were super friendly, checking in and making sure everything is ok. They definitely deserve a raise for their customer service skills. As well of the chefs for their cooking skills too of course. Delicious.

It was also quiet on a Sunday evening which was nice. Made for a nice atmosphere. Very chilled.","I have to say this place is a 10/10. I will admit I have a bias for Mexican food. It’s hard for me to leave with a bad taste in my mouth but this place is so good.

Restaurant itself is beautifully designed and the tunes are on point, but they need to fix the signage so people aren't consistently trying to open a locked door next to the table in the window.

We ordered the Bread with Garlic (should've got 2), Scallops wrapped in belly pork (chefs kiss), Tuna brioche toast (fold it and it eat like a taco) and the star of the show the Chuleton, sharing ribeye.

We ordered the:
Achoas - it is tasty and whoever loves anchovies it’s a nice experience.

Tosta de atun - Tuna with a lot of vinagre taste and soaked, it was good but nothing special.

Tortilla Vaga - This is definitely 5 start food, very tasty and well made .

Filete a la pimenta - I found very grease and lack of seasoning and creativity on preparing this dish.

Patadas trufa - very grease too as well as the filete a la pimenta.

The overall food was ok, but the price charged doesn’t align with the food.

Obviously you pay for the place named Michelin 2025 and the environment which is very nice.
