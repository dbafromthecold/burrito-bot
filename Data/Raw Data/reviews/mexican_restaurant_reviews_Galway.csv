You should definitely go here if you wnat to try burritos this is the bets in town the flavours in each bite, blended so well and comes out so good.

What we had in the burrito
- mexican rice
- chicken meat
- cheese
- smokey chipotle pinto beans
- charred corn
And mild sauce on top.

Well we also tried some oreo churros, so if you have a sweet tooth for churros def try this out. ❤️

For mains, two of us went for the chicken schnitzel while the third ordered fish and chips. When the food arrived, it looked incredible—and tasted even better.

Went to counter and was asked for €7.90. I pointed out the €6 deal and was informed that it only applies to a 6 item roll. I pointed out that means I'm paying more for less. Like a computer I was told it has to be 6 items.Probably becuase of the deli barcode ?
So I just said thanks and walked away and they can eat and drink the items tehmselves. Probably should have returned to the deli counter for more items but to be honest the whole episode annoyed me and that is the worst part because life is short and this type of nonsense is'nt worth getting annoyed about.
Still here I am typing out my thoughts on the issue so I must be bothered.
Cash register should flag only if roll has more items not if less.
Not really interested in going back there again despite the food looking good. Makes me wonder why I was asked at Deli for 2 of each or not told how that would impact on the advertised deal?","Spotted good deal of breakfast roll containing 6 items plus a bewleys coffee this monring for €6.

The lady behind the counter was super friendly, attentive, and quick. You order at the counter and the food is brought to your table — and even though the place was absolutely packed and she was working on her own, everything came out fast and with a smile.

There’s a big selection of homemade smoothies that perfectly round off the experience. Prices are very reasonable — actually a bit cheaper than most other cafés — and the portion sizes were spot on. The coffee was huge, and the food was delicious, freshly made, and arrived sizzling hot. Always a good sign!

Our visit was wonderful, and I can highly recommend it to anyone hungry or thirsty in Galway in the morning.","We found this small, rustic and cozy café thanks to a local’s recommendation — and what a great find it was!

Nestled on the hills with the wind from the Bay, the hotel exudes charm. We decided to dine at their Bistro, drawn by its inviting bright wood accents, large menu, fully stocked bar, and an impressive selection of beers on tap.

We started our evening with a variety of drinks: a selection of whiskeys including Hennessy and Jameson, a margarita, a few pints of Moretti, and a glass of Crucero. The bartender was friendly and knowledgeable, enhancing our experience as we chatted about the different options available.

For starters, we chose the Indian Dip and Wild Mushrooms. The Indian Dip, reminiscent of hummus, was a delightful mixture of curry spices and coarse chickpeas, served with Naan. The Wild Mushrooms, cooked in garlic butter and parsley, came with sourdough bread and 'rocket' (arugula). These starters were the highlight of our meal, especially the Mushrooms, which were prepared to perfection and could easily be the centerpiece of any meal.

Our entrees included a Steak Sandwich, Thai Curry, Chicken Goujons, Sirloin Steak, and Chicken Supreme. Each dish was a testament to the capable fare of a good hotel restaurant. I enjoyed a well-cooked sirloin with chunky chips, perfectly complemented by my whiskey. The Thai Curry, a vegetarian dish, stood out for its clean finish and rich flavors, while the Chicken Goujons were akin to chicken tenders in the States, satisfying and familiar.

The young, friendly staff added to the pleasant dining experience. After dinner, we relaxed in the hotel's warm and cozy lobby, furnished with cushy chairs and a few intriguing goods to browse. I particularly enjoyed reading about the hotel and their selection of Midleton whiskey. The grounds and gardens of the hotel were in full bloom, adding to the overall charm of our visit.

For anyone seeking a pleasant escape from gloomy weather, the Ardilaun Bistro and the hotel's lobby offer a great way to spend an evening. The combination of good food, friendly service, and a welcoming atmosphere makes it a memorable experience.","During an early spring visit to Galway, we found ourselves at the Ardilaun Hotel, meeting friends amidst warm and blustery weather. Nestled on the hills with the wind from the Bay, the hotel exudes charm. We decided to dine at their Bistro, drawn by its inviting bright wood accents, large menu, fully stocked bar, and an impressive selection of beers on tap.

We started our evening with a variety of drinks: a selection of whiskeys including Hennessy and Jameson, a margarita, a few pints of Moretti, and a glass of Crucero. The bartender was friendly and knowledgeable, enhancing our experience as we chatted about the different options available.

For starters, we chose the Indian Dip and Wild Mushrooms. The Indian Dip, reminiscent of hummus, was a delightful mixture of curry spices and coarse chickpeas, served with Naan. The Wild Mushrooms, cooked in garlic butter and parsley, came with sourdough bread and 'rocket' (arugula).

As it didn’t make sense to drive into Galway city for dinner, we opted to dine at the bistro downstairs on two separate occasions. Unfortunately, we were extremely disappointed both times.

The quality of the food was very poor. On our first visit, we ordered a chicken wrap and a chicken sandwich—both arrived with what appeared to be shredded chicken bits rather than properly prepared fillings. It was difficult to tell what exactly we were eating, as the chicken was mixed with some sort of sauce and presented in an unappetising manner, resembling leftovers.

On our second attempt, we tried the chicken curry and chicken goujons. Sadly, the result was the same—bland, tasteless food that did not justify the money we spent.

To be fair, the service was excellent. The waitress and bar staff were very friendly and professional, and the drinks were enjoyable with a good selection of wines available. However, the poor food quality completely overshadowed our dining experience.

I would strongly recommend avoiding this restaurant until the food offering improves.","We were residents at the hotel with our children and were availing of the gym and pool facilities during our stay.

Hotel double room smallish, as you’d expect from a historic, city centre building, but clean, well considered and practical.  The coffee maker is a nice touch. Only downside was that the heater/aircon unit made weird noises. The soundproofing seemed to be really doing its job though, considering that we were on top of a busy pub with a band playing, we really couldn’t hear much from outside the room.

The pub itself is a sight to behold. Amazing back bar, stained glass, split levels, expansive collection of whiskies, decent range of beers, a cocktail bar upstairs, live music most (if not every) night… we didn’t eat, but the offerings looked good.

Hostess in the bar was extremely rude and dismissive which was the only negative experience and very unlike the rest of the staff as Philip the duty manager was excellent great communication style and level of service was excellent even with such as busy restaurant. Reception staff extremely friendly and concierge staff equally so. Breakfast was excellent as was dinner some excellent menu options.

We stayed at this hotel for one night and had an amazing experience. The location is easy to access, and the ambiance is beautiful and welcoming. We were lucky enough to get an upgrade to a suite, which was a wonderful surprise. The room was spacious, well-decorated, with fresh towels and high-quality amenities. In addition, there were chocolates, coffee, tea, and complimentary water in the room – a really nice touch!

Since there was a heavy storm outside, we decided to stay in and enjoy the hotel’s restaurant. We were given two coupons for hot wine, which was perfect for the weather. We also ordered a pepperoni pizza and wings, both of which were delicious! The breakfast, served buffet-style, was very complete, with a wide variety of options for every taste.

Overall, our stay was an excellent choice. The hotel provides a full, high-quality experience. We highly recommend it and will definitely return!","Excellent Experience at the Hotel!

It was a perfect place to stay just outside the busy city and easy to get to just off the main carriage way. There's a bus stop at the hotel so we didn't have to deal with the traffic or parking in the city centre which was a huge plus and only took 10 to 15mins to Eyre Sq. The Hotel is lovely warm and inviting. All the staff from front of house , the servers even the house keeping were so courteous and were a delight to deal with. I've never been to such a more welcoming place. It was so great to see so many different gluten free options as well as other dietary requirements available on all the food menus from breakfast to evening meals. Although very busy when we were there due to Christmas party lunches and dinners the staff did not show one sign of pressure they were all under, perfessionalism shown through out the evening from all staff. It was an absolute pleasure to stay here and highly recommend it to anyone. We will definitely be returning for a very peaceful get away.","We had a 2 night stay in Dec for the Galway Christmas markets.

A few of the menu items had a local twist (like a hamburger bowl, a burger with cheese in a salad bowl) but for the most part, it's ""Burgers and fries and milkshakes!"". They even refer to the deep fried potato sticks as.....Fries!!

Prices were very reasonable, with table service (they took our order and brought it to us).
