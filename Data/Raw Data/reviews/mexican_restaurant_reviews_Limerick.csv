They offer different flavors to choose from, but I especially enjoyed the spicy ones. The customer service is great—very friendly and professional which makes the experience even better. The atmosphere is welcoming with great vibes. It can get a little crowded at times because it’s popular, and while the prices are on the higher side, the quality and overall experience make it worth it. Definitely recommend!","This was my first time trying Mexican tacos at Republic of Grill, and they were absolutely delicious.

Not a great option,I should have went for beef tacos..
Food was cold,the meat,or maybe that’sthe way should be served,fair enough.
Nice seasoning and nice fresh coriander.
I like the taste!
But the amount of onion,Jesus!
I will attach a picture.
Maybe that’s how it should be,but to be honest I would have preferred more tomatoes and less onion!
The pickled onion was nice and also the mango sauce OMG!!!!!! Devine!
Prices are good!
I will try one more time!maybe I didn’t choose the right dish ☺️☺️☺️🤪","First experience in a Mexican place ,so I didn’t know what to expect or what to order.I was recommended Cochinita Pilbil…

I asked for a burrito bowl with chorizo as a meat. When she opened the container, there is only few left (shown on the picture) and she shouted to her colleague for more chorizo. She decided to put the add ons while we are waiting for it. It is taking a while and I said that, if there is no more chorizo left at the back, I'll take chicken with it. From then she mentioned to me that she already put the chorizo. I replied and ask if it is really the portion size which she attitudely replied yes and moved on to a different customer. As we came from a very long trip, tired and non confrontational people, we decided to pay for it and it cost us 9 euro for this much food. 12 cubes of chorizo as protein. If the portion left is not enough, just say it directly so people can choose something else. It is embarrassing to charge people full price for this amount of food while other people received a decent amount of protein for almost the same price. I rarely write reviews but today's disappointing that it made me write one.","Today, after a long trip and extremely hungry, we decided to order a take out from boojum in Limerick today 24/6 around 9pm.

I know there are two chains and this one is newer, but honestly, if you’re going to do Mexican food, you need to do it properly.

If you’re going to open a place and charge restaurant prices, then do the food properly. Being a new business isn’t an excuse for missing ingredients or poor assembly. It’s very frustrating there is not one good Mexican restaurant around Limerick City bar Republic Grill, even though there not the best either but nothing has topped them yet in my opinion. I would have been better off to order boojum.

I ordered a burrito bowl and a lot of what I requested was missing. There were literally two jalapeños, so I had to add my own. The bowl itself was alright, but missing key ingredients, no beans at all, very little sour cream, and the avocado was hidden underneath everything and used very sparingly for the price. I also had to add my own cheese and jalapeños, which defeats the whole point of ordering out.

I like my food hot, so I had to reheat it but once you heat lettuce, it’s not nice. That’s on me for choosing lettuce, but it’s something I wouldn’t get again.

The dos tacos were nothing special and weren’t prepared properly at all. They were lopsided, poorly assembled, and arrived cold. Cold tacos just don’t taste good, full stop. The shell and tortilla just tasted like kitchen roll, and the meat was just as bad.

For a restaurant order that costs a small fortune, I expect to get what I asked for and for the food to be well prepared and enjoyable. I could genuinely make better Mexican food at home and open up my own food chain. That shouldn’t be the case when ordering from a restaurant. If this is how food is going out the door, then changes seriously need to be made. New business or not, customers aren’t test dummies. If you’re asking people to spend their money here, the bare minimum is that the food is hot, complete, and actually resembles what was ordered. Very disappointing","First time ordering from here after hearing a lot about it.

The nashville chicken burger was astonishingly good I would recommend, the chicken was juicy and fell apart in my mouth, the breading on the chicken was seasoned to perfection, the perfect amount of hot honey sauce that complimented the chicken incredibly well- not too sweet and not too hot, perfect. Sensational. Would come back again.
The dragonfruit diva is a drink I would recommend to ALL of you reading this. This cocktail was absolutely beautiful AND refreshing and as someone with a peach allergy, they had zero problems accommodating that for me.
This restaurant has the perfect portions for their desserts too. The dirty cookie is the best thing ive ever put in my mouth to explain it plainly.
The atmosphere was warm, cozy and perfect. With beautiful music playing at the perfect volume to speak over.

Our visit to Coqbull Limerick today was disappointing in several key areas.
Upon being seated, we were placed at a table that had visible dirt on it. Instead of cleaning it, napkins and cutlery were laid down straight away. This was unacceptable, particularly given that several other clean tables were available and remained free throughout our visit.
Menus were handed to us without any explanation of the Christmas menu or the Sunday roast. Customer service from the waiting staff was essentially non-existent from this point onward, as there was little engagement beyond taking the order.
When ordering drinks, we requested a jug of water. It did not arrive. We later requested a jug of water again, and while one was eventually brought to the table, it came without glasses.
We ordered two burgers. The buns were noticeably very cold, as though they had been refrigerated, which detracted from the quality of the meal. One burger was ordered with fries as a side, advertised at €4.50, but we were charged €5.50 instead.
No one checked on us during the meal to ask how everything was or whether we needed anything further.
The burgers themselves were average and unremarkable, with no standout flavours or elements.
The restaurant is nicely decorated for Christmas, which adds to the atmosphere, but overall the experience was not acceptable due to the lack of basic service, attention to cleanliness, and care. Improvements are clearly needed.","⭐️⭐️⭐️ 3 stars

I was greeted by a manager or supervisor named Emma over my call, so polite, down to earth yet very professional. She resolved all my queries in relation to the kiddies strick diet they have almost instantly, all I was left with was excitement for the kiddies reaction when I told them what they could order and as for their faces when eating.. lol. Very happy!

The food service and food that followed was of the best experiences I had with the flavor, cooked to perfection, portions full and of course, the service from all staff who played their part was top notch.

We were recharged.

Waited another 10 min, still no change, food not even marked out for delivery on the app.
Rang them up and guy on the phone told me they didn't have a delivery driver and then blamed justeat for allowing the option of delivery.

I was not happy about this as the food would be freezing but apparently this wasn't his problem or fault, it was between me and justeat..

This guy kept calling me brother and kept talking to me like i was a fool? I'm not your brother, and don't talk to me like that. He then hung up on me because he said I was being ""rude"" to him and I must have hurt his feelings..

Eventually, a few minutes later he
answered again and i told him i wanted a full refund and he said it was roo late because the food was on the way now. Bear in mind this was about 1.5 hours after the order. There's no way i was accepting this food but again he told me to ring justeat (which isnt possible).. Eventually he said he would cancel the order but i might not get my full money back as i had ordered food, the food was made and it was now on the way. Then he started saying i would get a full refund after all. I told him there were 2 options either i get my full refund or he would have serious problems.

So, my whole night was ruined but luckily enough for him, the refund came through or else his week would have been ruined.. Absolute disaster of a place, stay away..

The restaurant is well presented, spacious and a nice atmosphere. Upon arriving there are a flight of stairs down to the restaurant, I imagine making it difficult for wheelchair users to attend.

Service: I called to make a reservation, imagining on new years day it would be busy. I was offered 20:00 on the phone however managed to secure a 19:30 booking using the open table app.
Upon arrival we were greeted promptly and shown to our table which was ready for us.
Once sat, we were offered the drinks menu and given a bottle of water for the table.
Service, food and drink delivery was very prompt - Almost a little too prompt as it did not really allow for any kind of settling before the next course arrived.

Food:
Drink: We both opted for a pornstar martini which arrived as you expect, garnished with a passionfruit. It was a good cocktail.
Starters: For starter we had the loaded potato skins and the garlic mushrooms, both were nicely presented and a suitably sized portion. Both tasted great and would recommend to anyone  attending.
Mains:
For main course both my girlfriend and myself opted for the beef and chicken fajitas. These were exactly as you expect, severed on a sizzle platter and a generous amount. As with most fajita dishes in restaurants the accompaniments felt a little disproportionate to the meat, however well filled wraps ensure that the three supplied tortillas can be enough, with a little left over, If I was to suggest improvements I would suggest possibly 1 more tortilla and a little larger portion of sauces to ensure there is enough for the amount of filling you receive.
Deserts:
For desert we opted for the strawberry Eton mess and the chocolate chip cookie jar. Both were great deserts and a suitably sized portion for a third course. Both were presented well, however the ""cookie jar"" wasn't what you expect with it being served in a glass ""bowl"" rather than a jar, however this did not take away from it being a nice desert.

Atmosphere: on New years day evening the restaurant was busy however not at capacity. there was a good amount of space between tables a noise level that allowed for easy talking without having to shout over other noise.
The restaurant was nicely decorated with beef references adorning the walls, however not to a level of tacky, it was nice. Also with it being the festive season there was still Christmas decorations up which whilst being festive also didn't go over board.

Final notes: Great restaurant with good food and good service, would recommend to anyone in the area.","First impressions: My Girlfriend and I had dinner in Texas Steakout on Jan 1st whilst staying at a nearby Hotel.

However, management and staff attitudes are poor. Cash is very much looked down upon. Tills all have signs saying that they are closed and to use the kiosks. Staff will begin by asking you (after leaving you standing there for a minute or two)  if you are paying cash or card, if you say card, they'll ask you to use the kiosk, if you are paying cash, they'll walk away and leave you wait a few more minutes.
It's really disappointing to see a business that clearly sees cash paying customers as a burden to them.
I understand that it may be more convenient for you to do business using cards, but at the end of the day, it just shows a sense of laziness, and is no excuse.
In general, staff taking orders can be fairly rude and don't seem to pay too much care towards their work.
While the food is always good, some serious work is needed on staff training and management attitude towards paying customers.","Food is consistenly good, prices are reasonable.

It’s a quirky luxury boutique kinda feel when you enter into the pink and green interior festooned with everlasting floral arrangements, panelled walls and contemporary furniture.

We settled in the bar with the groups of ladies on brunch and residents from the hotel getting ‘tucked in’ to the cocktail list.

The friendly and sartorial team looked after us with aplomb. We were recommended and  enjoyed a bottle of the pink Cremant €58 - very good value and delicious.

Beetroot Gravlax with citrus, small cubes of cucumber jelly served with stout bread, tomato soup and home made fat chips… YUM - Who doesn’t like a ‘picky’ lunch with chips and bubbles? Demolished in no time!

There is more substantial plates upon the menu and what looked like a delightful afternoon tea being served around us and quite possibly at some point we will be back to partake.

A very nice afternoon was spent plus we dodged the rain… Total win win.

I absolutely loved the salad — fresh leafy greens with sweet roasted pecans, creamy goat cheese, beetroot, and their own in-house dressing. It’s simple, but the flavors are so well balanced and refreshing. A real standout!

Another highlight was the garlic and cheese pizza with a gluten-free base. It was perfectly crispy and packed with flavor — a real treat!

The roast beef was incredibly tender, served warm with a rich, flavorful sauce and perfectly cooked vegetables — not overdone, just right.

And the desserts! The mango and yuku cream brûlée was light and delicious. I also enjoyed the apple crumble served with custard, ice cream, and fresh fruits — comforting and so satisfying.
