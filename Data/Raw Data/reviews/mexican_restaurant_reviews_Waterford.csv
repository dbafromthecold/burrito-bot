The restaurant was closing and had cleaned up and said they aren't making the orders. Told the driver to mark them as collected. He was then stuck with the orders on his app and couldn't do more orders (driver is top rated). Shameful that the restaurant didn't even call themselves.

Update: As much as I'd hate to drag a family business, the way you treat customers here is disgusting. I posted this a month ago, got a reply fairly quick but can now see they've edited their response one day ago. Horrible to be blaming Uber and the drivers when they're the only ones who made contact, you were probably home and all by then. The food was not late, it was refused to be made. Driver was in an awful panic. Hilarious reading all the reviews, but what's even funnier is the we checked CCTV response.. had an issue like this before, claimed staff aka family ""didn't do it"" and insisted I was lying about an order being wrong. Told them not to bother checking but they called back to say the camera showed driver taking wrong order which was a lie since rest of order was perfect.

I walked into a colourful and charming tacoterie, clean and well lit where two friendly staff members welcomed me with a warm greeting and we shared commiserations on the cold outside the door.

I ordered a chilli beef burrito.

From the moment we walked in, the restaurant atmosphere felt warm, vibrant, and genuinely Italian.
Exceptional Service is the Standard
The staff at Emiliano's truly elevated our special evening. They were attentive, incredibly friendly, and went out of their way to ensure our celebration felt personal and memorable. Their service was seamless efficient without ever feeling rushed, making us feel completely looked after from start to finish. Big thanks to the team for making the birthday celebrations so wonderful!
The food was the absolute highlight. Everything tasted incredibly fresh and authentic, showcasing true Italian passion.
For starters, we enjoyed the Bruschetta perfectly toasted bread topped with fresh, vibrant tomatoes, mozzarella, and aromatic basil, and fresh Burrata on  delicious, soft fried dough, perfectly complemented by worm Mediterranean salad.
For the main courses, we were equally impressed. The spaghetti fruit do mare was outstanding generously loaded with fresh monk fish, prawns, mussels, clams, and calamari in a rich, deeply flavored tomato sauce, pure comfort food executed flawlessly. We also had the rack of lamb which were cooked to perfection, tender, and juicy, served with a gorgeous, dark reduction sauce and perfectly prepared seasonal vegetables.
Emiliano's isn't just a meal; it's an experience. If you are looking for delicious, high quality Italian food paired with warm, genuine, and professional service in Waterford, look no further. Whether it's a casual dinner or a special occasion like a birthday, Emiliano's is the perfect place. We highly recommend it and can't wait to return!","My partner and I recently celebrated his birthday at Emiliano's in Waterford, and the entire experience was nothing amazing.
