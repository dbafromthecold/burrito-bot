West Gourmet Sandwiches is a Mexican restaurant in Belfast. Customer reviews say: Ordered a superfood salad online today for lunch.  Was ready for collection when I arrived and plenty of parking for pick up.  Salad was gorgeous. Massive portion and good quality tasty food. Got an Americano too which was delicious. Will definitely be going back, hidden gem of a place! | Went in at 12 today after recommendation from a friend who'd seen it on social media. Menu was vast and I couldnt really read it because other people were standing infront. Asked my very friendly server what the most popular sandwich was and she informed me the chicken supreme or harissa chicken with goats cheese. I went for the later. It was a taste sensation. My mouth is still watering. Absolutely delightful. Will definitely return. | I'm in Belfast for a few days and was recommended West's yesterday for lunch.  I got their special (no photo unfortunately) and it was absolutely fantastic. So much so IV gone back today and got the same sandwich, but in a baguette (yesterday's was in focaccia).  The staff are super friendly and the sandwiches are full to the brim!!  I will be going back tomorrow (if time allows).  If you're coming to Belfast and looking for a well priced lunch, that's going to keep you full until dinner, I can not recommend West's enough. | Me & my partner ordered from here for our little ones Gender Reveal and we're absolutely over the moon with the buffet we chose. We went for Menu B and opted for the satay chicken instead of the sausage rolls. Absolutely gorgeous! We had about 40 people attend and they all said how delicious and well presented it was! We will definitely use here for all our future functions! A big thank you to all of the team, from the lady who helped us book, to the kitchen and delivery guy! Thanks Joe & Bekah | We chose West to cater for a family birthday party at home. From the point of ordering the staff were extremely helpful and on the evening the food arrived bang on time. West provided an absolutely delicious and varied selection of sandwiches, wraps, mini burgers, sausages, chicken gougons, chicken skewers and vegetarian options. Highly recommend and will use again.
Common Market is a Mexican restaurant in Belfast. Customer reviews say: The place was a bit underwhelming. Loads of vendors were closed even though we were comfortably eating and drinking within the opening hours.  Food was fine (looked better than it tasted) but the bar was really really slow!  The place felt a bit lifeless and so I wouldnGÇÖt bother returning | Absolutely loved it here, lots of different food stalls so loads of choice on what to eat, I opted for the tacoGÇÖs from SicarioGÇÖs, which were huge and really tasty. The only downside in my opinion is there arenGÇÖt enough bars inside which means you can queue for a while. Great atmosphere inside and really good vibe around the place, well worth a visit! | We had so much fun here Great selection of food Plenty of seating Good location  Already looking forward to the next busy | Gorgeous food market. Would definitely recommend when in Belfast. Loads of food options for everyone. Fantastic musician/guitarist performing when we were there too.  I opted for the Mexican place and got a beef birria rice bowl which was very filling and very tasty.  Only downside is drinks only available at the bar. Could definitely do with having non alcoholic drinks like water at the stalls themselves so that you donGÇÖt have to join a long queue of people getting beers and cocktails for a cup of water. | While the entry fee is only -ú1, the state of the facilities is completely unacceptable. I headed to the restrooms immediately upon arrival and was horrified to find extensive mold and exposed, live electrical wires. Due to broken lighting, two stalls were in pitch blackness. While I understand venues struggle with upkeep, these are serious safety hazards. The overall cleanliness was so poor that I felt compelled to leave immediately. I cannot recommend this venue until they address these basic hygiene and safety standards.
The Burrito Bar is a Mexican restaurant in Belfast. Customer reviews say: Delicious food, lonely atmosphere, will be comming back here again. | Called in yesterday, amazing food and staff were extremely welcoming. Will definitely be back | I eat a lot of burritos, has there a great healthy food to eat while youGÇÖre on the move. This was one of the best burritos IGÇÖve ever had in Ireland. Thank you! | Loved it got a burrito with shredded beef and the full works not one complaint I think it might be my new regular go to takeaway | I love the burrito usually but tonight it was dry hardly any sour cream or cheese sauce on it very miserable hardly any onions or peppers was very disappointed very dry
Bright's Restaurant is a Mexican restaurant in Belfast. Customer reviews say: This place is not fancy - more of a diner style cafe - but the large breakfast fry was excellent and the service was friendly. They missed an egg off my portion and it came within 30 seconds, once I had alerted the waitperson. The coffee was fine, although the cappuccino came without chocolate on top. | The smoked cod was interesting, I liked it but it was just a bit on the salty side. The peas were soggy unfortunately. Very healthy portions though. Decent prices for what youGÇÖre getting. Staff were lovely and attentive even though it was quite busy. The place itself is nothing fancy, but itGÇÖs clean and tidy, and wasnGÇÖt loud even though it was busy and music was playing. Not sure IGÇÖd come back, but it was nice enough. | Honestly just had my worst meal IGÇÖve ever had in Belfast. Fish and chips, shouldnGÇÖt be that hard but wow did they mess it up. Came in two tiny slices, completely burnt and hardly any fish. It was straight up eating bread and batter. It was disappointing and disgusting. I had two bites and just sat there eating the chips. My partner ordered the chili chicken and he said it was just fine, didnGÇÖt fee well 45 min later. Too many places here, this was a big waste of money and time. Disgusting. | Nice enough place. They didnGÇÖt have enough cod for all 5 of us to have fish and chips which was odd but that happens. Nice enough food. -ú20 for fish and chips seems a little OTT for a basic cafe but itGÇÖs not ridiculous prices. Not one to go out your way for but if the Northern Whig wonGÇÖt let you in cos your wearing trainers then take your parties. -ú120 to them. The staff were very friendly. | Always get great honest home cooked meals here. Great selection and great chips. Went for the Christmas chips, best around in my opinion
Wok A Moley is a Mexican restaurant in Belfast. Customer reviews say: The Best Salted Chilly Chicken & Curry Sauce in Town..This place is very popular among crowds after club or night out. The food is very tasty and fresh as always, never had any issue. I always order from here and never disappoint. | Food was over priced, didnGÇÖt get a proper portion size for the price that was paid, disguised, foods not warm had to be heated in microwave no flavour, never order from here again. Chicken is Pink. Was for a resident in my care home and now scared incase something happens to them eating pink chicken | Ordered a delivery, delays for about an hour, then when I rang they said my order was on its way. Nope, marked as delivered but nothing came, absolute disgrace. Do not order from this poorly managed restaurant. | Found boss man's nail clippings in my food which caused me to chip my tooth. In response I brought a shopping trolley inside with my friend in it to attack boss for his actions. However no success was made in taking down this disgusting establishment. | As a half and half Chinese Mexican immigrant myself this fusion between Chinese and Mexican food was right up my street! My good friend aayush has been ranting and raving about this place, to be honest he always smells really yummy. Like curry. I hypothesised this was because of the food here. However he must just be taking curry baths because the food did not taste nearly as good as he smells. I did however enjoy the abundance of bossmanGÇÖs toenails in my food. Will be back to stalk handsome brown boys.
Boojum - Botanic Avenue is a Mexican restaurant in Belfast. Customer reviews say: One of the best burritos you'll get. They can be a bit stingy with the meat filling. I've also found the pork has lost its flavour over time. Expect to queue when you go - not because they are short staffed but because it's so popular. | Quick service, good quality, reasonable price and good value. But the only toilet has a broken handle and the music is too loud, hard to hold a conversation, please turn it down and call a plumber for extra =ƒîƒ | Staff to worried about pivk ups and not us customers who walk to this shop to be treated horrible by staff. Chicken was cold and said had no pinto beans when after serving me a takeaway order got them. Completely let down by this visit will not be back and will be telling everyone of my friends and family and Facebook people about how rude there staff have become. | Staff need an attitude check to be honest, especially the larger man who wears a beard net and the skinny guy who does the sauces.  I donGÇÖt get any beans or vegetables in my bowl so I always ask for extra rice, it usually isnGÇÖt an issue any other time IGÇÖve been in however the larger man told me heGÇÖd put it on at the end? IGÇÖm assuming he probably thoughts IGÇÖd just forget about itGÇª  When it came to actually getting my extra rice the skinnier guy pointed to it and said GÇ£you wonGÇÖt get much more in that mateGÇ¥ basically saying no extra, which just made things extremely awkward and most people would just drop it there but when youGÇÖre charging 13 quid for a burrito bowl you can bet that I will get what IGÇÖm paying for.  NEVER had an issue like this before and I understand that you guys were busy at the time but a bit of respect goes a long way. Also no manners whatsoever and rushing everyone through their orders is just nasty.  IGÇÖll be going to great Victoria street from now on never had a problem there | The tacos were swimming in liquid and were not very pleasant. Also, the chicken consisted of tiny bits of dark, shrivelled meat. I contacted Boojum and they did not respond.
39 Gordon Street is a Mexican restaurant in Belfast. Customer reviews say: Went to a drink and draw night here with a friend and it was so much fun, I don't think we interacted with the permanent staff only the staff that were running the drink and draw but they were all super lovely and really hosted a great evening | Good music.  CouldnGÇÖt quite comment on the price of drink though.  Friendly staff.  A bit quick to lift glasses of drink off an unoccupied table - whilst people are dancing.  Can be difficult to get served at the bar and limited seating.  Toilets surprisingly clean for such a busy place on a Saturday night | My first time being in 39 Gordon street and I loved it. The atmosphere was fantastic staff friendly and the music was brilliant. It was live singers and they were amazing will definitely be back =ƒÿü | I worked a drink and draw at this venue in their outside area and it was really lovely, great people, staff were polite and everyone attending the event loved the location, I would visit again just to relax and have a drink | nice bar in the city centre
The Spaniard is a Mexican restaurant in Belfast. Customer reviews say: The lady who served my Guinness didn't let it sit, and then wipe the head off with it with a knife.... Gf accepted it. Good service, Clean, Music, it's a nice pub. | The Comedy night with James have been amazing fun.  James Downey is a great host and fun comedian. I enjoyed the evening ( Craig the ging) even i didnt understand all the jokes. Staff at the bar was friendly and drinks avordable. | This bar used to be one of my favorites but the level of service has seriously went downhill. The girl that served us tonight was rude and totally incompetent. When we asked for drink it was a major hassle. Then when we went out for a cigarette a came back ahead had binned all our drinks. | Nice little bar whether you are upstairs or downstairs. Downstairs is brighter and the upstairs is a little more cozy and fun decor filled with images of the sacred heart plus some random dressy dogs.  The pina coladas are surprisingly delicious. | Lovely bar. But the attitude of Santa Claus bouncer needs to improve. Everyone was ready to leave and just singing the last played song in the bar, but he was very aggressive asking people to leave. We pointed out it was 5mins to closure time as a bit of banter to say "we're gonna leave after this" and he got very confrontational telling us to leave immediately.
Stereo is a Mexican restaurant in Belfast. Customer reviews say: Wow! We have been trying to get to Stereo from it opened after seeing the food photos on the socials. Today we arrived. From the moment you enter the customer service is exceptional and staff are passionate about their jobs and the food they sell encouraging us to try the Hash Browns. I had the Potato and Chorizo and the wife had the special, the BLT. We had to have side portions of hash browns and black pudding too. With a constant top up of water through out I wish they had a tasting menu to allow us a little of everything. Thank you for a brilliant experience. | The coffee and food was amazing. I had a strawberry and cream waffle with an oat latte. My partner had a hot chocolate with the breakfast sandwich. The servers were really nice and friendly. It took us a while to visit this place because there's usually a long queue but we got lucky and went on a week day and it was lovely. Would definitely go again but only on a week day. I voted the atmosphere as 4/5 because the only comfy seats there are the booth seats by the wall. | Go here if you can! Food was amazing and the coffee was fantastic. The service was awesome as well. We were passing through Belfast and stopped just on chance and we are so glad we did! Definitely a highlight to our Northern Ireland trip! | Absolutely amazing food, went for brunch and left very full and very happy. The guy who owns the place was lovely and friendly but also very knowledgeable about his food and the fancy filter coffee, it's so refreshing to eat somewhere that doesn't just sell boring fry ups! I particularly like the fact that as soon as you are seated they bring you some water!  I had the corn hummus on sourdough which came with poached eggs and I added sausages and it was fantastic, whatever they soak the tomatoes in was so good, even the sausages had a wee kick to them and my eggs were perfectly poached!  My hubby had the sliced potato and chorizo with crispy fried eggs and it was a lot of eating, he said it was the best brunch he'd had in a long time, they even make their own chorizo with pork mince nuts and spices it's a deconstructed version so none of those crap chorizo sausage slices.  You have to check this place out! My only complaint is that my cappuccino wasn't big enough =ƒÿå honestly though you must try this place! | Genuinely used to love this place but haven't been for a while. I came back hoping it would be as good as I remember it but genuinely entirely disappointed. I wasn't greeted at the door but instead called over to from halfway across the shop, where I was entirely misheard. Instead of coming over to clarify, the conversation continued from four metres away while I continue to try and ask if I can sit in. I got the hummus and grilled corn on toast and I was so disappointed the grilled corn was fridge cold and the hummus was for the most part inedible due to the odd texture. I said the hummus was inedible to staff and instead of offering any solution a supervisor told me it's because of the nutritional yeast in the product, which isn't advertised on the menu. Honestly really disappointed as I wanted to continue loving Stereo but after this experience I cannot recommend it
Haptik is a Mexican restaurant in Belfast. Customer reviews say: Visited here this morning with my wife. Our first time at Haptik, and have to say it was really excellent. Service was top notch and food was so delicious. Coffee was great as well. I had the Huevos Rancheros and my wife had the Baghdad Eggs. Really really good - would highly recommend. 5 stars G¡Én+Å | Great spot that we never tire of! Food is always fantastic and my iced latte hit the spot on a warm day =ƒÿü Breakfast roll and shakshuka! Took no time at all and service is always friendly. | Food is always beautifully presented and so delicious! Lots of choice for vegetarians and they were also happy to replace the meat in the special. Very friendly staff, always glad to come back whenever we're in Newtownards | Yes, I can buy and eat my own flowers for breakfast! Beautiful brunch enjoyed on my first, but imagine it will not be my last, visit to this fantastic cafe in Newtownards. Choosing gluten free cost me my sausages but the dish more than made up for my initial disappointment. Food quality was superb, portion generous and the gluten free bagel was a bonus. Would heartily recommend. Very friendly and helpful servers and I loved the interiors of this place as well. Note: at busy times you may have to wait for tables of four but I was quickly seated as I only needed a table of one. Totally worth a wait though if you ever find that there is one! | All round awesome.  Staff were friendly and attentive, atmosphere was nice and the food was outstanding!!  Mushrooms on toast really inspired me to try new things when cooking at home and my partners waffles were incredible.  We will definitely be back.
Pablos is a Mexican restaurant in Belfast. Customer reviews say: Nice Mexican atmosphere, exceptionally friendly server who made us feel welcome and promptly delivered three very large meals. The midweek taco deal at -ú13 was great value given the quality and portion size of food. Also a nice location to sit and watch time go by in the busy shopping area of the city. Hard to see how you could go wrong with pablos given their variety, taste and various deals through the week | Belter of a burger and equally impressive fries. Perfect for the end if a good night. Staff were great sorted us out with seating upstairs when place was busy. 10/10. | The burger was pretty bad. If youGÇÖre gonna insist on well-done bc you lack the kitchen permit or meat quality at least go with a thin smash patty or season properly or something. This was thick, grey and dry. Also room temp bc of the service. V sad bc the bun and toppings were solid. Onion rings were insanely greasy but I was so hungry I ate about 2.5 of em before feeling queasy. The service was really cold, I felt like an intrusion on their vape breaks (which I couldnGÇÖt care less aboutGÇªvape away bro). | Yeah really enjoyed the meal here. Great place for a quick, filling meal during a pub crawl. The vibe is burgers with a South American feel, so you get good tacos and really tasty nacho cheese sauce etc. The margaritas are fantastic too, and they were only a fiver as well. Bustling and busy, and cosy. Great dirty fries, good falafel, great staff. | Best gluten free dirty fries you'll find in all 32 counties!! Gluten free burger is fantastic too, highly recommend GÿåGÿåGÿåGÿåGÿå
El Habanero is a Mexican restaurant in Belfast. Customer reviews say: The food here is absolutely delicious and extremely fresh, my new favourite now being the quesadillas. The service was great and there is a wide variety of options - IGÇÖll definitely be returning for another amazing experience | It was gone too quickly to get a proper photo. Got a quesidilla on the way to the bus stop on a whim as a quick snack.  Pork was so fresh... Melted in the mouth  Guys English wasn't great. But tbh that's a green flag. | Best burrito in Belfast. Staff are very friendly, and all the food tastes great. Every option for burritos is worth it, so well worth the weekly visit. | I bought a Cuban sandwich on Saturday morning. Fresh and so delicious. CanGÇÖt wait to go back and try the burritos. | A highly recommended experience, the food was very good, we loved it. The staff were very friendly. We will definitely be back every time we visit, 10 out of 10 for service. Thank you very much.
Pepe's is a Mexican restaurant in Belfast. Customer reviews say: I had ordered chicken rice meal. Got the chicken rice hot flavour , with soggy fries.  Customer service it would say is poor. I agree to previous reviews they really donGÇÖt seem to be bothered about it.  I got the fries really soft and fried twice as i could feel from the taste. I was so hungry and thought would have PePes peri peri but I was wrong for the choice.  If you order please double check if its fresh.  Have a look at my pictures of fries in the worst condition i have ever had.  This is the second time experience i have had with pepes now. | Previously, I have given a 1 star for this review due to the behaviour of the old staff. But today, I have revisited the place, and I was greeted with new faces. The new staff are friendly and professional. They maintained cleanliness and often come upstair to clean and pick up the leftover/trash even when the condition is a bit busy for them. An excellent change of atmosphere, I really hope the new staff are not a temporary thing and the condition can be maintained. The foods are as tasty as other pepe's branches. Good management choice. | DonGÇÖt try this place the food is stink if u donGÇÖt want to play with ur health donGÇÖt eat from here .. | Pepe Restaurant serves some of the best chicken, and their unique spices make the flavour stand out. The food is consistently tasty, and you can really notice the quality in every bite. Overall, a great place to enjoy well-seasoned chicken and a satisfying meal. | Very slow service. The food wasn't very good. The paneer loaded rice had so much salt in it, it was inedible. I've eaten in lots of Pepe's branches all over the UK and never come across so bad.
Flout! is a Mexican restaurant in Belfast. Customer reviews say: I came here recently during lunch time. Had heard some amazing reviews, hence thought to give it a go.  The queue was alright. Ordered 4 different types of pizza slices,. The service was fast and staffs were very friendly.  I found the pizza's taste to be average. The base was very hard and tough to chew and felt the pizzas were too salty. The taste didn't meet up to the hype. | So, I went here with my wife and 3 year old son on a whim knowing it's always busy, with no expectations of getting in. Luckily we walked right up and got served by the most hospitable guy with a beard. When I told him I had never been before, he kindly talked me through how it all worked, what each dish was and made us feel very welcome. He also offered to exchange any food order we didn't like, which was a really nice touch for customer service. Honestly, it was a short but sweet interaction that made us feel welcome and appreciated - this makes all the difference in the world.  Of course we did not need to exchange any slices we ordered as they were all absolutely incredible. The pepperoni and Vodka Sausage were both fantastic. Would highly recommend both. My son had a classic slice of Margherita and he ate most of it without complaint (was slightly too big for him, but I gladly helped him finish the portion).  Will 100% come back on account of both food and service. As it is a bit more expensive than its competitors, the service really tipped the scales on whether or not I'd return. The pizza is top quality, but it's the service that made the whole thing exceptional. | Was excited to try this place after seeing plenty of videos on social media.  It did not disappoint, next level pizza. Crusty base, all homemade fresh ingredients including flour.  Really really tasty. | I really like the concept of this place (different varieties of pizza and by the slice), but the pizza didn't wow me unfortunately. It was quite good and I enjoyed the more interesting toppings available (like the sprout one!) but to me, nothing super special considering the huge line out the door. | Pizza was good i tried three slices, one of which was a spicy meat and it was lovely and definitely very filling but the waiting times are a bit mad as the slices are re-heated which slows the que alot..also tried the ranch but dont recommend as I found it had no taste whatsoever. They ask if you want extra toppings which included hot honey, basil and some sort of cottage cheese which I got and they all went well together =ƒæî
Sicarios is a Mexican restaurant in Belfast. Customer reviews say: Really good tacos packed with flavour but was a hefty -ú27 for the two dishes, I think a few added salsas/guacamoles in a pot on the side then it would be justified | Ordered here today, first of all what is up with your staff. So impolite. Second of all, to charge 16 quid for a burrito that has about as much flavour as a boiled spud is something. No spice, no salsa, no sour cream, actually had to double check this wasnGÇÖt a frozen burrito from Iceland.. Paid an extra 3 quid for guac but sure they didnGÇÖt wack it in, not sure it would have done much for flavour anyway. Had to open it up to have a nosey, and yes confirmed all dry no flavour a lovely 20 quid spent. | ShouldGÇÖve realised when we arrived and there wasnGÇÖt a single person in the queue that it was best avoided. The staff were absolutely miserable GÇö not an ounce of customer service. It was genuinely awkward ordering, as they didnGÇÖt say a single word, not even a simple hello. The food is extortionately priced for what you get: dry, tasteless, and completely lacking in flavour. To be fair, it looks appealing, but thatGÇÖs about as far as it goes. Definitely wouldnGÇÖt return, and I wouldnGÇÖt recommend anyone else waste their time or money here. | The person who served me kept vaping while working at the stall... gross.  The food tasted okay, super expensive, but it made me feel a bit sick about 6 hours after eating there.  Hygiene was definitely an issue, and on previous visits to the market, the staff was rude and smelled like alcohol. | Never usually write reviews but feel I must after an awful food experience yesterday (Sat 22 Nov 2025). I ordered tacos and I got a soggy cold salty mess on a plate. I am convinced they had been lying around for a while and reheated. Unfortunately in contradiction to my better judgement, I ate them. I am have regretted that decision every minute since. I will now actively avoid this food outlet and strongly recommend everyone else does the same.
Taquitos is a Mexican restaurant in Belfast. Customer reviews say: IGÇÖm so glad that the Boss still serves me as I come at the very second it halfway closing. The all time classic burrito is nothing I have tasted before. Fresh ingredients and is very unique with its secret sauce. The chicken inside is real juicy. They outdelivrted my expectation. Its premium pricing is justified. | Incredibly good tasting food, best chips of my life. Really good lads to talk to as well, great stories of where the food has come from. Insanely good chips honestly, crispy as and so fluffy, tacos and Garybox was incredible, really good food and fills you so much | Fabulous food and incredibly friendly and informative service! All gluten free made it a super treat! WeGÇÖll be back. Maybe today. | Stopped on way to the Belfast giants. Unbelievably tasty, the 2 gents running it were hilarious and very friendly & the tacos and nachos amazing.  Will be back for more. An artist behind the grill and can taste love in his food!! | First time trying birria tacos - my life is changed for the better=ƒñ» I mean holy shit look at the photos, this was a cathartic experience  The men that run the van are absolutely lovely too!
Munch Belfast is a Mexican restaurant in Belfast. Customer reviews say: Was in Belfast for the day for Boundary jubilee festival at the Portview trade centre. This came highly recommended  Two of us had the full Irish breakfast and one a burger. We all had coffees. The food set us up for the day. Would I go back ? 100%. They even serve beer. Think I saw one lad drinking a pint of Guinness. | Visited yesterday and I would highly recommend! Super friendly staff and quality food, the eggs benedict with a choice of salmon or bacon were on point, absolutely delicious! I opted for the salmon. | We visited from Alabama USA and had Munch on our list for a Full Irish Breakfast and did we get a Breakfast.  The wait staff is wonderful in the kind service we received unlike many places in the US. They treated my wife and I as if they had known us forever. Now,  the Breakfast was unreal. I am a big man at 6'4 and 235lbs and no way I could eat all on my plate although I wanted to devour every bite. I recommend that you visit if you plan a trip to Belfast. You will not be sorry and make sure you are hungry.  Thank you to all at Munch. You gave us a experience to remember. | Food 10/10- service 10 /10 - atmosphere 10/10  Munch is one of my favourite places in Belfast for breakfast. ThereGÇÖs a huge selection, and breakfast is available all day. The quality of the ingredients is excellent. At weekends the place can get busy, but itGÇÖs worth the wait. The atmosphere is great, the staff are very friendly, and the food is very well priced. Highly recommend this place. | What a wonderful find after a chaotic morning of travelling. Huge menu selection, very reasonably priced and great portion sizes. A hidden gem for sure, Charlene and the girls are a credit to your team and go above and beyond to cater to everyone's needs. Will definitely be back the next time I'm across the pond!
Bootleggers is a Mexican restaurant in Belfast. Customer reviews say: Very tasty burgers, I had the one with fired Camembert. It was delicious! And not to mention the sweet potato fries sent me to heaven. Warmly recommend this place. Book upfront! I was alone and they made exception to accommodate me on one bar table. | Best bar ever in Belfast!! Sooo so nice, OMG that burgers!!! Like heaven=ƒÿï beautiful...and the Blue moon beer! All the staff are very friendly, very cool place. So big american style bar, very spacious, cosy. Highly recommend!=ƒÿì | Good and service was so gooood!! Wanted all the foodGÇª ended up ordering too much though because it all looked & sounded so good. Highly recommend their nachos and chicken wings!! | Amazing food , The Plain Jane burger was one of the best I have had. The music and atmosphere were fantastic. I Would highly recommend! | The staff extremly welcoming and kind. Food is amazing. Best burgers and fries =ƒññ=ƒÿü
The Burger Club is a Mexican restaurant in Belfast. Customer reviews say: Lovely friendly, modern restaurant. Food was amazing especially the loaded fries. Service was great, fast and polite. I would highly recommend this little gem everyone. | I rarely write reviews but we had the best food tonight at The Burger Club Belfast. It was my sonGÇÖs 13th birthday and they kindly let us share a surprise video message from his friends on their big tv screen. My son said it the food was 10/10GÇª the best cheese burger he had ever tasted. We shared starters of peppered chicken with tobacco onions and peppered sauce on chips and chicken wings smothered in Franks hot sauce. I had the peppered buttermilk chicken burger. Was perfection too. If only you could taste it from the photos. | Came in for some lunch. The burger and chips were fantastic. Presentation was great and the food didnGÇÖt take so long. The young waitress was very sweet and polite however there was an older woman who was a bit more bull than lady. Maybe a bad day? Probably more of a bad life. She might need to settle it down. Other than that angry grey cloud of a woman it was a nice feed. | Great little spot! Burgers were first class, as we're the goujons. I got the Christmas applewood smoked burger and loved it (a word of warning, the goujons come with chips. I didn't know that and was quickly stuffed!). I tried the mozzarella sticks and peppered loaded chips too and they were very tasty. All washed down with a biscoff milkshake. 10/10 will be back!! We booked a table and it was quiet when we arrived but got busy real quick so I'd recommend reserving if you're going around dinner time. | Great fast food burger joint that has the nicest burgers with a great menu choice. I love the Korean sticky chicken burger always my go to. Great section of dips to go with succulent chicken wings and loaded chips. Full bar licence which serves cracker selction of ales an Madri on draught perfect all rounder that goes down nicely with a great burger. I always sit in but you can do takeaway an they deliver.
Stran-wiches is a Mexican restaurant in Belfast. Customer reviews say: First time trying Stran-wiches today. My friend and I went at lunchtime for takeaway and were served immediately by a very pleasant member of staff. The music in the shop when we arrived was very loud, but a member of staff must have thought so too, and quickly turned it down a bit. I ordered the Reuben with pastrami, cheese, pickles, sauerkraut and mustard, and my friend ordered the Mexican chicken on a wrap. We waited less than 10 minutes until our order was ready, and we were able to pay separately using both cash and card payments.  Now, onto the sandwich itself. I personally didn't feel that it was worth -ú12 for the size of my Reuben, and at -ú11, my friends' wrap was even smaller still. My foccacia was quite dry, and I'd have loved either a dipping sauce or even a little bit of mayo in addition to the mustard. There was SO much sauerkraut that I couldn't taste the cheese at all. I love sauerkraut and pickles in general, but to have so much on there that it overpowered everything else was really disappointing. The flavour profile was just really unbalanced for my taste, though the pastrami when I tried it by itself, was thinly sliced and super tasty.  Now, onto the reason for the low rating. Most deli's will wrap a sandwich in paper, slice it in half, and THEN wrap it in foil. At Stran-wiches, they wrap it in the paper and foil and then slice it which means that when I went to eat my Reuben, I kept finding tiny bits of foil throughout the first few bites closest to where it had been cut. I found this really off-putting because it effectively forced me to use my fingers to dig through my sandwich to remove them, which on an airated bread like foccacia wasn't easy!! Such a silly mistake to make, but it significantly affected my enjoyment of my lunch, and my first impression of this place.  My friends opinion of her Mexican Chicken wrap was that everything was fresh and the texture of the wrap was so pleasant, but the sauce was so overpowering that it was all she could taste. After eating her wrap, she was still a bit hungry too, which after spending -ú11 definitely shouldn't be the case.  Overall, I'd probably go back to Stran-wiches and maybe try one of the salad bowls next time but I think, especially on Stranmillis where you have really class places to choose from for lunchtime offerings, it would be way lower down on my list. | IGÇÖve been to stranwiches a good number of times and I have loved it every time. It does depend on the menu whether or not I go and visit but most months you will find something you like or want to try. My favourite will always be the turkey sandwich with pear slices, it sounds weird but it is the perfect combination. I think their sandwich ideas are original and cater towards everyone. As everything is fresh to order and there is always a line you can be waiting for around 15 minutes which seems like a long wait but gives you time to go next door for some traybakes or across the street to the shop and I would say the wait is worth it because the sandwiches are huge and have sometimes done me for lunch and dinner on the day. | Very decent hand made fresh sandwiches/wraps and focaccia, with very interesting fillings and ingredients. Excellent flavour and presentation (with maybe a bit too much filler lettuce?). Certainly a "wee treat" place as apposed to a daily, given the prices. Fair play to the owners to get away with it around Stanmillis, but it seems way above, +c.50% more expensive than other very similar places in Belfast (e.g. Tasty Nosh, Stacked, Thyme, West). Serious hipster tax. | Salmon and cream cheese bagel was lacking in the salmon department considering the price. My colleagues also found their Caesar wraps and turkey club quite disappointing for the price and the wraps were short on meat. Wait time was also a bit on the extreme side. Overall a grand lunch and does the job but really not worth the price. | Stu
Revoluci+¦n de Cuba Belfast is a Mexican restaurant in Belfast. Customer reviews say: We came on a Sunday evening and they had a live band at just the right volume. It's huge and ornate. As a visitor to Belfast, I was generally disappointed by the range of beers (craft beer doesn't seem to have reached here), but this bar had a somewhat better selection than most. | We went for the Happy Hour, you could get 2 of the same cocktails for -ú12 and 3 different tapas for -ú19.50. The food was better than I expected. They also had live music the night we went, the singer was very good. | Food was of excellent quality for such a lively bar/venue. Harry and Katie made us the best Mojitos we've had in years and we've had lots! Great spot and I'll be back just for the cocktails and friendly service   please keep it up, keep the staff and keep hiring well =ƒæì | Great food, friendly staff and lovely ambience. We will definitely return. | We came here for our work's Christmas 'do'. It wasn't our first choices, but we wanted a good night out, and Revoluti+¦n de Cuba looked good - on paper.  The atmosphere was lively, any other night, it would be perfect. Unfortunately, it wasn't ideal for us; far too loud, so loud we couldn't hear what the person, who was sitting next to us, was saying. Usually on a 'work's night out', the ambient music is lower during meal times. I understand this is more of a club scene, and if we were just going to use it as such, it would be fine, and my ratings would reflect this, but as a Christmas meal venue, it did not work for us at this time.  The food came out promptly, as we had pre-ordered that was to be expected, my starter was nice, except I wasn't expecting hot chilli peppers on my prawn cocktail. I suppose that was a Mexican twist on a Christmas classic! My slow cooked beef was chewy and not very warm, but my pudding - banana Eton Mess - was delicious! For the price, I would've expected better.  All in all, as a Christmas meal venue, it did not work. As just a Christmas drinks night out, it would've been ok.
BaoBun Botanic is a Mexican restaurant in Belfast. Customer reviews say: The meal deals are very convenient, the food tastes very fresh and fragrant, I had the Pork bao bun with House dressing (SZechuan, Asian slaw and crunchy shallots), with fries poutine and a drink for 12.25-ú, a very filling meal! I got it take away, but there are a few tables to dine in as well. I recommend it! | First time here and gotta say the food is so good Staff are so friendly helpful which is what you want Portion side was good and enough IGÇÖd definitely recommend here | I recently visited this restaurant for the first time and unfortunately, it was a disappointing experience overall. The food was just average in taste, and the portion sizes were surprisingly small for the high prices being charged. Definitely not value for money. However, the biggest letdown was the attitude of one of the senior staff members. As it was our first time there, we were a bit unsure about what to order and had a few questions. Instead of being helpful, the staff member was very rude and seemed to be in a hurry, which made us feel uncomfortable and rushed while ordering. Customer service is just as important as food quality, especially when welcoming new guestsGÇöand sadly, this visit fell short on both fronts. Not a place I would recommend based on this experience. | I visited this restaurant for the first time recently, and the overall experience was quite disappointing. The food itself was okayGÇönot bad, but nothing specialGÇöand the portions were rather small considering the high prices.  The main problem was one of the staff members wearing black glasses.Since it was our first time there, we asked a few questions about the menu, but instead of being polite or helpful, the response was rude. Their attitude made us feel uncomfortable and not welcome. | Our hotel was located close to BaoBun Botanic, so we decided to stop by and try it out GÇô and it turned out to be a great choice! The staff were very friendly and helpful from the moment we walked in, and they gave us good recommendations, which made a great first impression. We ordered the bao bun set, the wings meal, and a half-and-half meal with fries, rice, and crispy chicken. Each set also comes with a drink, which is definitely a nice bonus. The portions are quite generous GÇô one meal is more than enough to feel full and satisfied. As for the taste, everything was absolutely delicious: fresh ingredients, well-seasoned meat, and a great balance of flavours. The restaurant is located on the ground floor, so itGÇÖs easy to access with a stroller. There is seating available inside, and a few tables outside as well, which is perfect if the weather is good. We will definitely come back during our next visit to Belfast. BaoBun Botanic is a great spot GÇô tasty food, reasonable prices, and very friendly service.
La Taqueria Ormeau is a Mexican restaurant in Belfast. Customer reviews say: Very nice food, felt authentic. It wasn't greasy at all, but wasn't anything super healthy either. But it definitely hit the spot, very comforting. Minus one star because it was under seasoned. I'd definitely recommend trying the fish tacos =ƒññ=ƒññ | Fantastic food and drinks. One of the best margaritas in town. Interesting, well executed menu in very decent prices. Service somewhat spotty but fine. Atmosphere could be improved but overall definitely one to recommend when around Ormeau Rd. | Starters and mains were delicious but we were served over cooked mole fries. The hot sauces were HoT with lots of flavour. Wide selection of drinks. Menu was difficult to read, and the bathroom is in need of a deep clean, hence the 3 stars. | A delicious lunch, ingredients seemed fresh and presentation was really good.  There could have been a bit more food for the price. This said, I will definitely go back, just not when I'm really hungry. Taco Tuesdays are a great deal,-ú10 for 2 tacos. | This has to be one of my favourite restaurants, we all ordered quesedillas with a side of chorizo potatoes and it was so filling and tasy. The drinks were also amazing. I really recommend trying this mexican
SmashnBird - (Botanic Avenue) is a Mexican restaurant in Belfast. Customer reviews say: Wow, wow, wow. Right let me start with the negative: itGÇÖs bloody hard to pick something off the menu. Like literally I was stood for like 5 solid minutes in complete indecision, thereGÇÖs sooo much incredible looking stuff. I wanted the wings but it looks like they come in a massive portion and I already had more than enough.  In the end I ordered the bacon and cheese burger and the spice bag fries (way too much for one, but I really couldnGÇÖt pick). Served was prompt and very friendly. We took a seat and the food was all brought out surprisingly fast.  The burger was good and plenty of sauce for those that like it saucy. Overall - a good burger!  The real star here was the loaded fries though, wow, amazing. The curry sauce was just like what youGÇÖd get from a Chinese and there was just the right amount of chilliGÇÖs, spring onions etc on top. Bursting with flavour and the perfect amount of spice.  Not a Belfast native but canGÇÖt wait to get back and try something else =ƒÿï | The burgers here are very good.  The bacon and blue cheese burger was tasty as was the bacon double cheeseburger. The patties are quite thick, not like smash burgers.  I really enjoyed the spice bag chip which is basically a curried chip but I loved the curry sauce on it.  Right up my street! | This place was fast and the portions were amazing! The size and fla or of these burgers should have them getting a flavor time award! The chips were done perfectly with amazing flavors. | I would always recommend here but this time was well below par unfortunately. First I waited 35 mins for a take away order of a portion of large wing and a buffalo fries. I waited soo long people who had arrived after me had eaten their food and left. I have gotten up to check on it and shortly after it has emerged which to no surprise the order was wrong I ended up getting a regular set of wings and a somewhat of a sad looking chip with very little chicken on it.  ItGÇÖs not like Tribal to be like this hopefully next time itGÇÖs better/quicker. | Had good craic wif my mates here but the bruger was a wee bit dry could be the fact IGÇÖm pick asf and got only lettuce n red sauce but idk had better taste like Burger King wee but only difference is u need a tenner for this one.
Sozo is a Mexican restaurant in Belfast. Customer reviews say: Thank you for the wonderful service today. The service and food were superb. They even cater to the palate for little ones. This is my second visit to this place, and it hasnGÇÖt disappointed me. I will definitely return to try the rest of the dishes on the menu =ƒÿï. | Nice sea shore restaurant with yummy food. We enjoyed the starter, main course and dessert. The price is also reasonable. Service is very good. I would love to visit again. | This is a fantastic place!! We got steak, chunky chips, onion rings and pepper sauce.  This was AMAZING!! And the pepper sauce was gorgeous!  We were 'talked into' trying a dessert =ƒÿë lol, and oh my word, the raspberry ruffle cheesecake is out of this world!! It had so much flavour! The best out of anywhere else that I've tried!! The girl that was our waitress was lovely!! She was so friendly and down to earth and great craic!! It just made everything perfect!! I would highly recommend Sozo to anyone.  I for one will definitely be back!! | This is our second visit and we will be back on our annual trip to NI. Such good portions and food so tasty ! Plenty of flavour. Guinness on tap too | Absolutely fantastic restaurant. We had a lovely meal tonight and the Staff were lovely. The manageress is a very warm and lovely person.  Chatted to us tonight as always. Missed Robert tonight who is a super amazing person too. Quality of food is always fresh and really nice.  Definitely worth popping in for something nice to eat.
The Treehouse is a Mexican restaurant in Belfast. Customer reviews say: Went to a wedding reception here and it was beautiful! Fairy lights all over the walls and the pretty tree in the middle of the room was  a lovely centrepiece. The sun was out so the roof was retracted for most of the evening which made it feel so much more spacious. Staff were friendly and very helpful. Negatives? Only one really, I thought the prices rather steep, -ú4.30 for a straight vodka is expensive by anyone's standards. | Food was Outstanding, staff were so attentive even though it was busy, social distancing were fabulous. We got a great seat and the sun blessed us with its presence which topped off our visit, highly recommend the burgers and mojitos x | We had an excellent evening in the Treehouse. It was my first time out since lockdown and it was my birthday so expectations were high. From arrival to departure the staff couldn't have been more helpful and attentive. The food was excellent and there was a great ambiance. They have done well retaining a beautiful venue whilst adhering to current Covid regulations. | Nice rooftop and ambiance. Drinks were very nice though quite pricey. Our appetiser (charcuterie) was very nice. However, our main meals were mediocre, and especially my steak was very burnt. The place was busy and the waiters/waitresses couldn't be attentive though understandable (cuz there were lots of people after some restrictions were lifted). | I went on a sunny Saturday lunchtime around 1pm and it was empty. Which was great for me as I got a window view and to marvel at the interior. The food was lovely and tasty, clean and simple. I can only imagine how crowded this place would be in an evening but on the flip side how much fun. I do remember thinking how clean everything was and how much dusting must go on with all of the interior designs but hey not my problem. Strong recommendation to visit eat and enjoy if you are in Belfast.
Town Square is a Mexican restaurant in Belfast. Customer reviews say: Tried the sweet chili and girl dinner stack! Belfast version of our Canadian poutine! I have to admit, it was quite good! Lots of savoury chicken! Dressing was good! Guinness tastes way better here than back home too! Staff was extremely courteous. | This bar is 10/10. The drinks are always amazing. It is the perfect date night spot. | Very friendly service when I entered The girls working knew the menu and had great knowledge Very friendly in getting me seated Food quality was great Used the QR reader for a coffee which was very efficient | Popped into Town Square in Belfast and had such a great experience. The staff were all super friendly, knowledgeable, and really efficient. Our server, Grace, was especially lovely; I asked her for a white wine recommendation and she suggested the perfect one. Great atmosphere, great service. Definitely coming back! | Lovely warm bar. Great food, staff are really attentive and nice (without being in your face about it). There's a nice buzz! Would definitely come here again
Urban Scullery is a Mexican restaurant in Belfast. Customer reviews say: It's inside Deer's Head, without it's own individual signage.  So just go inside.  The seafood chowder is outstanding.  Served nice and hot, as all soup should be served but sadly is rare these days.   The shrimp in particular is cooked expertly just to the edge of being cooked.  You'll want to try one quickly, as the hot soup will continue to cook them.  The fish and chips also outstanding.  A delicate and crunchy coating.  Not greasy at all.  Fish fresh and moist.  The chips/fries are steak cut and lightly seasoned.  Gotta eat those Irish potatoes at every opportunity =ƒÿü  And an unexpected nice touch- the booth had two USB charging outlets.  Nice... | Found this place inside the deers head. What a treat! Service 10/10 staff super friendly and helpful . Went above and beyond to accommodate an allergy concern too. We had the Sunday roast which was exceptional. If you are in the area this is for sure a great place to visit. | A brilliant pub with a great drinks selection. The Garstang are knowledgeable and friendly. We visited on a Friday,  there was a fantastic Irish tradition session from 5pm onwards. Everyone in the pub was welcoming and the atmosphere was very nice.  It gets quite busy but its a very well managed bar , with a lovely sociable environment. | Very tasty food with apparently a regularly changed menu.  We enjoyed the smoked salmon and chicken pate appetizer.  The steak entree and chowder (filled with unshelled clams and mussels in the shell with a side of yummy bread) was rich and nicely cooked.  The bar the kitchen is in serves good cider,  specifically aspall. Service was a little funky but otherwise a great experience. | Quality of food and ingredients was top tier. EveryoneGÇÖs meal was so thoughtfully prepared we will be recommending Urban Scullery to everyone!! Best chicken wings in Belfast thatGÇÖs for sho. Staff were also top tier and very attentive G¥ñn+ÅALSO AMAZING VALUE
Bad Boyz Burritos is a Mexican restaurant in Belfast. Customer reviews say: Very disappointing. The food was bland and flavourless. The portions were too small for the price. Both meals had items missing, even though we had to pay extra for the add-ons. DonGÇÖt be fooled by this place. Cheap quality food for high prices. | One of my favourites places to order food. Great value for money, foods always fresh and prepared to perfection and the staff are always lovely! If I could eat out of in here every day I would =ƒñú please excuse the half eaten food but I can never wait for a picture =ƒÿì | This wee place is smashing. My wife's Mexican and these flavours are as close to home as she has found here. We have tried many different Mexican places and this one is top. Guy serving us tonight was a complete gentleman. Don't expect cheap food here. Expect good food at a good price. I recently paid the same amount at the kebab shop on the same row of shops and the food was inedible and went in the bin. So for price comparison this is far superior. Well done guys and thanks again | Absolutely delicious and a great price for lunch deal. Amazing customer service. It's our Saturday treat every week and travel from East to West Belfast. Staff are so pleasant | I went in during a miserable wet evening. The staff were lovely. There were no tables and I wanted to eat at home so I asked them to double wrap my burrito. It was still warm when I arrived 20 mins later!! Delicious burrito and good value too! I got the 50/50 so had the pulled pork and chorizo, both lovely!
Little Mexican Deli is a Mexican restaurant in Belfast. Customer reviews say: Glad to find vegan vegetarian options. Large portions and helpful and friendly staff. Made the rookie mistake of calling GÇÿnacho chipsGÇÖ Chips in Ireland =ƒÿ¦ here chips are potato fries!!!  So instead of nachos and guacamole we got fries and guacamole =ƒñö=ƒÿò wee bit disappointing. The beans and Mexican bowl was a generous portion and with  great flavours. There salsa is not vegetarian/ vegan which is surprisingly so ( why add meat in everything) wish they would add vegan cheeses to their menu as the enchiladas we got was without any cheeses. Would definitely come back again if in the area. Great value for money. Lovely vibrant decor. Came back so hungry that we forgot to take pictures of the food=ƒÿï | Class wee spot, boys serving all friendly and polite, decor in sync with style of food and the food is fantastic, great value and large portions, 6 dishes all delish, fresh and super tasty | The delivery fee on the website is an absolute joke. Including delivery, fee and bag price your paying an extra fiver, same as on JustEat. IGÇÖll never fault the food but youGÇÖs seriously need to sort it out itGÇÖs completely a disgrace, puts you off wanting to order anything and your gonna lose customers that way IGÇÖve been lost as a customer for a long time now as someone who loves this place as I have not been able to order from there because no excuse to have to pay an extra fiver. No excuse for it whatsoever. | Lovely food when the incompetent ginger fella taking orders over the phone can get an order right. Firstly just out of hospital with my child, tired and just want something to eat. Place and order for myself partner and 2 kids. Sent home with a missing burrito bowl that was my child so had to go back and get it, while said member of staff,  more or less said it was in the bag when it WASNT. CCTV IGÇÖm SURE would pick that up when the bag was being packed . THEN get home and cut my own burrito with beef in it when I ordered chicken. Had to go back to the shop a 3rd time to face disgusting attitude from this we man while still implying in some sort of way that IGÇÖm trying to get free food. just home from hospital and simply wanted a meal. Will never set foot in the place again..and I think IGÇÖm out -ú20 in fuel the amount of times IGÇÖd to back kind of defeats the purpose of a stolen burrito bowl!! | Been coming here for years me and all my family had a really horrible experience today actually physically feel sick from the way the owner(lady) spoke to me ordered a burrito meal with other stuff the forgot my chips burrito had no sauce in was really dry but anyway I rang to say the forgot my chips and I will never forgot the way the owner spoke to me eat your burrito now and youGÇÖll get your chips in 20 minutes or put it in the oven for 20 minutes she really wasnGÇÖt bothered I  didnGÇÖt order food to reheat I explained to her the burrito hasnGÇÖt been opened IGÇÖd give it back to driver for a fresh one as it was going to be cold the way she spoke to me like it was my fault the had forgot the chips I will never and I mean never order from here again and neither will any of my family and I feel so sorry for the girl that answered the phone cause she was so nice wen the owner was that rude to me can only imagine what way she treats staff today for your rudeness you have lost a loyal customer that has been coming to yous years and will never step foot in your shop again me or any of my family and btw lately yous are always forgetting something from the order yous should wake up and take the order write
Seed is a Mexican restaurant in Belfast. Customer reviews say: First opportunity to visit Seed today and we went for breakfast! =ƒñù My only critique would be if you are sitting in to have proper bowls, plates and cups. However maybe it just caters for take away, didnt take away from the experience. | My patience has run out with Seed. These have been my experiences: Pros- atmosphere and expedient service, some pleasant employees, and the nice concept of healthy, customisable dishes. This was reason enough to be a regular. On the flip side, my negative experiences are adding up to never want to go there again. I was happy to ignore the dozen times IGÇÖve gotten undercooked sweet potato and rock-hard stale rice, but this is now the third time IGÇÖve gotten mouldy ciabatta from here so I have to say something. YouGÇÖd think for the price they would care enough about their clientele to pay attention to the freshness of their food or at least give some substantial remuneration for the disgusting shock of eating mould. I wouldnGÇÖt even care as much if I wasnGÇÖt feeding this to my toddler. Unacceptable. The pictures included are of the bread in my lunch today. It tasted so off, I should have known before eating half of it! | Got the buffalo bowl with ans extra goats cheese and was incredible. So filling it got me 2 portions! Best salad bowl IGÇÖve ever had. | I'll be honest, I wasn't entirely thrilled when my partner suggested a salad bowl for dinner but good Lord, that was delicious.  I had the Katsu chicken bowl and it was so flavoursome, really low in calories and obviously healthy too. Will be back for sure! | I had a very bad experience,Since I have asked for bread toast with plain cheese.So there is no way for mistake.I clearly told about that nad asked for vegetarian food. Initially they said yes and when I took my wee one for toilet and came back they kept everything ready in a bag,But when I went home and took the items out, I have a wrap with meat.This bread toast which I have ordered is for my wee one who is sick and slept whole without having anything.I felt so sad and so much disappointed and depressed as I could not able to feed my wee one who is sick.This is totally unacceptable.So I never suggest this restaurant to anyone.
Boojum - Lisburn Road is a Mexican restaurant in Belfast. Customer reviews say: Was nice but not as good as it used to be. Staff arenGÇÖt particularly friendly and was very expensive. Got 2 kids portions (charged per item), one bowl and 3 drinks -ú26! Nice vibe in the restaurant but difficult to be parked nearby. | Not as good as it used to be , loyal fan for many years across the Belfast stores attending weekly at times .  Prices have gone up as expected but paying near -ú13 for a half filled basic bowl and tin isnGÇÖt good. Takeaway by Uber  can also be very disappointing and more so expensive. The staff come across as burnt out having to deal with long queues and also having to deal with demanding Uber delivery drivers lingering over the tills. And with one staff member at each station trying to keep up with demand quality is going to always slip. I can go into m and s next door on the Lisburn road  and pick up quality tortillas for -ú1 but not in Boojum.  I hope Boojum finds it moe joe againGÇª. | I love the food and get it often. I find their selection expansive, you can really essentially have whatever you want there which is great. It's super easy for everyone to find something you can eat which is great for groups with mixed dietary needs.  I just thought I'd note the issues with labelling as I got a nasty surprise because of that unfortunately. It would be one thing if there was a clear key indicating what means what but there wasn't so I defaulted to the standard understanding I have. | -ú9.95 And thatGÇÖs where itGÇÖs filled up to - what a joke - how the mighty have fallen - pathetic No wonder their stores closed in England | Server gave a portion of pork using tongs and then came back after 30 seconds and decided to take part of the portion back, there is no specified measuring cups like for the chorizo. Completely arbitrary decision to take some of the food back even though other burritos around it had visibly larger portions. Seriously not impressed.
Bebe Adrianos Mexicanos is a Mexican restaurant in Belfast. Customer reviews say: Very tasty Mexican food! The steak and chicken with sweet potatoes and chips were surprisingly amazing, and the crispy chicken was so so good too. Authentic ingredients, real Mexican.  The people were so kind and they gave us a sample when we didn't know what to get.  The chicken burrito was a little bit sweet for me but everything else was amazing. | The food doesn't live up to the high price unfortunately. The single person portion of -ú4.25 "restaurant skin on" chips were not "skin-on' they were just basic chips you'd buy from Asda and were soggy and undercooked. I had to put them in my air fryer for 10 mins. The Chicken burrito was tasty and a decent size but again was it worth 20% more than a B00jum? No. The Veggie Bowl was very disappointing, not much actual veg included and still well over a tenner for what was mainly rice! Wouldn't order again in a hurry, sorry. 3 stars because I'm feeling generous. UPDATE (reply to the restaurants reply on my chips photo, that I can't seem to reply to) I used your app, so your prices, your menu. Please don't try to make excuses or blame someone else for serving overpriced underwhelming food. | I can happily say Bebe Adrianos never misses, having become somewhat of a regular. Boojum who? Bebes blows them out of the water. The food tastes fresh, delicious, and packed with flavour. Happy tummy and happy customer! | -ú32 for two burritos. Flavourless rice, veggie burrito without any vegetables? Just rice, cheese, salsa and sour cream. Pretty disappointing given the awards. Had much better, fresher & cheaper elsewhere. | Have never eaten from here before so decided to try tonight. I went for the Christmas chip and husband got tacos with salt n chilli chicken. After 1hr and 40 mins it arrived. And boy were we disappointed. My chip was mostly sweet potato fries, small amount of turkey, even less ham, 4 chipolatas and I'm not sure there was any stuffing. Husband's tacos were actually swimming in the oil in the box he couldn't finish his as it was just too oily. i know it's saturday night, it's busy i get that but really disappointing when you wait so so long for not great food.. sorry
Peperi.co is a Mexican restaurant in Belfast. Customer reviews say: Ordered from Peperi Co tonight as the reviews on Deliveroo were really positive wish weGÇÖd have checked google beforehand and avoided the disappointment. Order was over 50 minutes late at this point, Deliveroo wouldnGÇÖt allow us to cancel the order we were convinced the restaurant had forgotten the order because when we called to chase it up the phone was continuously disconnected. They have their own in house drivers so Deliveroo couldnGÇÖt even get an update for us either. Eventually after 55 minutes of waiting we decided to drive over to the store to enquire and received a call five minutes after leaving from flatmate letting us know the food had arrived. After the wait I could say the food was disappointing and IGÇÖd be underestimating how bad it was. The tacos were completely inedible as the shell had disintegrated from being in the box so long. Chips were wet and soggy. Everything was stone cold. Worst take away I think IGÇÖve had and such a waste of almost -ú30. If youGÇÖre thinking of ordering I would save your money, time, and energy because Peperi is a really bad experience. Rated one star because no stars wasnGÇÖt an option. | Had to get the girl to remake my burger twice and both times cold in the middle! When I first came in it took her 10 minutes to figure out she had an order because she was too busy on her phone and had no inch of care when I said it was cold in the middle. Disgrace of an establishment. Sort your staff out. | Ordered the supreme burger and it was cooked perfectly, stayed piping hot on the walk back to work. Owner gave us a free portion of chips too, lovely service and great food | I had just ordered bubblegum milkshake via Ubereat and it tasted like crap. How come they mixed water in the bubblegum milkshake and made it taste so bland just like normal water. What a disappointment and waste of money. If you are out of a bubblegum milkshake, you should call your customers and confirm whether they want to change the flavour or not, not mixing it with water or you could ask the customer to cancel if you are out of bubblegum milkshake. The place is great but the milkshake is horrible. Will never buy here again | Placed an order on just eat and the driver completely stole the order, I have tried to contact the store about this and have received no answer what so ever
Hendrix Restaurant| Belfast is a Mexican restaurant in Belfast. Customer reviews say: CouldnGÇÖt fault this place at all. Service maybe a little slow but I never realised how big it is inside! Honey chilli chicken was fabulous and my wife loved the Hendrix fries alongside her smash burger.  We sat in the wee terrace, I would probably recommend sitting inside to be honest, but still didnGÇÖt mind either way. | Started with the chicken parm and the corn accompanied by the some fries. The corn was nice as it was done a little differently to what you would normally expect. The chicken itself was oozing with flavours and I loved the little roquito peppers accompanying it they really gave it some extra zest. My fries were on point just how I enjoy them. For dessert I enjoyed the affigato which was something a little different the amaretto flavour works wonderfully with the expresso. They staff were lovely and courteous throughout I couldn't fault them | Their burgers are absolutely delicious?! I'd definitely go back just to get one again. Lively atmosphere, nice cocktail selection. Handy to go to if you're seeing a show in Lyric Theatre. | My Husband and I called in for lunch one day. We were seated straight away. Cheeky cocktail ordered for me and food. Super fast service and staff were lovely. The food was amazing. It was a wet and windy day when we called, so not many diners, but I'm sure it would normally be buzzing. The place was decorated for Halloween and it looked great. I've recommended to several friends and I will definitely be back again | We found this place around a year ago and have been back 5 times since, itGÇÖs become our favourite restaurant. The food is amazing, and so is the service. CanGÇÖt recommend highly enough. We were here tonight for my wifeGÇÖs birthday and both canGÇÖt wait to come back. The tacos are unreal! And the Hendrix beer is very good. Give this place a go, you wonGÇÖt be disappointed.
Soul Food Cafe is a Mexican restaurant in Belfast. Customer reviews say: I came in Thursday evening for the new late menu and the food was delicious. Fantastic wings, and the shroom and onion burger was very tasty. Great chips too. Not licensed but got a bottle from the Vineyard a few doors down.  Great food and good prices. Definitely will return. | Been coming to Soul Food Cafe for years now so I was pretty excited to see theyGÇÖve started a new evening menu.  Easily the best burger youGÇÖll get on the Ormeau Road, by a mile. The menu is really varied so thereGÇÖs no shortage of new things to try. Good portions, good prices, good atmosphere.  10/10 GÇô canGÇÖt wait to go back | Love the chicken and leek soup and the tuna melt toastie. Always get delivery but will make sure to get sitting in at some point in the new year. Definitely recommend. | Very good overall one of the best IGÇÖve had. Employees were nice and there seemed to be a lot of deliveroo workers getting food from it so it must be popular and I really enjoyed all the employees had a smile on their face good amount of choices on the menu and I have got to recommend the chicken tenders and regular fries the pesto pasta was great. If you donGÇÖt know what to eat I strongly recommend here overall absolutely amazing. | Sorry to report the worst cafe experience in many years. Arriving at 2.30pm, I asked if the kitchen was still open and was told yes by the waiter, who added, "We close at 3." I asked if that gave me enough time to order a salad and was told yes. I asked for the Goat Cheese Salad, which arrived promptly.  The ingredients were fresh and generous, but strangely a large portion of hot onion relish had been dumped on top of the cheese.  It ruined the dish. At that point a few other customers were heading for the door, and I spotted a friend going past with his dog. He popped in to say hello at the same time as the waiter started to scrape and pile up the chairs around us. I said, I thought you said you close at 3pm?" To which he muttered something under his breath. I couldn't make out what was said, but it was nothing good.  My lunch was half eaten but my plate was removed from my table. I couldn't understand why the waiter behaved like this. Maybe he was having a bad day. I just wanted to cut my losses and get out of the place. Up I went to the register to pay. The same waiter, I'm not kidding, asked me, "How was everything?". I answered, "It was going OK until you threw me out". He then said, "I didn't ask you to leave." There are some situations in life which are not worth the effort, and this was one of them. I was charged -ú14 for a partial salad and a tea. Won't be back.
Med-Mex is a Mexican restaurant in Belfast. Customer reviews say: I love the food cooked here and I recommend a hundred percent coming here. The cook takes great care on preparing the food, marinating the meat with spices and herbs which makes the flavour fantastic. This food is not fast food but food properly cooked with a great flavour. Staff is nice and helpful and prices are great! If you want to try good food in your lunch time come here, you will not regret it! | I love Med - Mex. It's easily my favourite place for Mexican food in Belfast city centre. I love their burritos and go here for most of my lunches. Everbody in my work loves here too! 5/5 and I would definitely recommend either the chicken or beef burrito. They also have very good looking pizzas in store too! Brilliant little hidden gem | Hidden gem!! Me & my husband are hooked we always have a burrito.  They are so good we haven't tried anything else on the menu lol  they are so fresh tasty very filling, made and served by such friendly staff.  Good value for money.  Believe me once you have a burrito here u won't go anywhere else | My favourite authentic Mexican =ƒç¦=ƒç+ burrito SheGÇÖs just amazing | Some of the best Mexican food IGÇÖve had in a long time!!! Such a gorgeous depth of flavour and smokiness from fresh frying on the grill
Boojum - Great Victoria Street is a Mexican restaurant in Belfast. Customer reviews say: Holy heck the burrito was heavy! Stuffed full of ingredients and rolled tightly, the burrito is really good value. Salsa was the perfect heat and rice just as good. Staff were friendly and atmosphere was good too :) | Visited during a weekday evening, was very quiet. Once I had got to grips with the menu options, I went to the counter to place my order. Service was quick and friendly. For me, food was tasty and it tasted fresh. Plenty of seating - my only complaint seating inside was music was very loud......but I am getting old! The food was very good value in my opinion. If I wanted a quick meal and something tasty, I would visit again. | First time at Boojum on Great Victoria Street and honestly, such a great experience! The food was amazing, fresh, and full of flavour. What really stood out though was the service GÇö especially from one staff member (an Indian guy with glasses). He was super friendly and helpful, took the time to explain how everything works since it was our first time, and even gave us a few meat samples to try before choosing. He suggested combos based on our spice tolerance and flavour preferences, which made a big difference. Even though it was a bit busy, he never rushed us and seemed genuinely happy to help. Massive shoutout to him GÇö he made the visit 10x better. Definitely coming back! | I had a burrito bowl and it was good for what you pay. It was fast and convenient when hopping on the train. The place was clean. I wish they took cash.  These young ladies working behind the counter are FAST and efficient. They were whipping out click and collect and serving walk ins without missing a beat. Kudos to the young staff here!!!! | Well, well, well.... thank you so much for giving me enough time to do a thorough meditation before ordering, I was afraid, that with only two clients ahead of me this would be too quick. Teach the people to enjoy slow motion when ordering. Good that the staff always takes care to bond, and chat. Also, it is good to have the lil bottles empty, that teaches you to eat pure food. I loved the staff arrange a full decoration with three new and a dozen empty bottles. What an adventure.
Madisons Sandwich Co is a Mexican restaurant in Belfast. Customer reviews say: Sandwiches are lovely. The Yard was delicious and the tray bake was spot on. Nice wee spot. | Really sub power sandwiches charged at a premium rate that anyone could make at home. The taste of the sandwiches was very underwhelming partly due to the basic quality of the ingredients. For an equivalent cost Yellow Door when it was opened served higher quality ingredients and bigger sandwiches for the same cost. | I mean the picture explains my disappointment. You would expect good quality bacon and smashed avocados with nice long strips of brie. The "guacamole" was definitely some shop bought guacamole not a  fresh one. If you're wanting a  sandwich I would just go to subway if I'm honest. Really not worth the value for money. I mean by all means raise your prices and then make the sandwich more full. But I think you can do alot better. | This place really has went down hill used to shop a lot great well filled sandwhich . Got a sandwich today .disappointed when I opened it to say the least. -ú7.50 a bit of ham and bit of turkey and a bit of salad . Shocking price for all that was in it . Won't be back for sure . | The customer service isnGÇÖt great. The staff donGÇÖt acknowledge you upon entering or really converse with you at all. Head down the entire time and just continue talking to their coworkers. You feel like youGÇÖre bothering them and the sandwich was pretty tasteless. The sandwich was GÇ£ cut in half GÇ£ but more like the knife just touched it. Had to rip it apart
No 14 at The Georgian House is a Mexican restaurant in Belfast. Customer reviews say: I recently had a splendid dinner here with my boyfriend and his family. As the only vegetarian on our table with some intolerances I felt that the No. 14 team did a fantastic job accommodating to my needs, sharing a wide selection of options that were delicious. The pear and ewes cheese salad was just mouthwatering! We will absolutely be coming back to try out more of their delicious menus. | Outstanding service and quality restaurant.  The filet mignon was a superb cut, chunky chips cooked to a crisp, butter sauce, and the carrot/parsnip great.   Highly recommend, atmosphere comfortable and social with tables of 2. | One of the best value for money classy and well put together meals I've ever had, class dishes that are seriously tasty and superbly presented. Wish I lived closer, I'd be in there once a week! Staff and wines were top quality too. These guys know how please, get there and enjoy :) | We're so pleased we found this restaurant...we can't praise it highly enough. It's particularly good for those needing strict Coeliac / Gluten free options where nothing seemed too much trouble. Also very dog friendly in the bar-cafe area & their rear courtyard seating are, we had a fabulous evening meal and then returned  to sample their extensive breakfast menu a couple of days later..both times with our pooch happily esconced beside the table . The staff were extremely welcoming & helpful, the food was beautifully prepared with quality ingredients, good portion sizes & absolutely delicious. Excellent advice re their wines. Prices fair as reflect the quality of their offerings.  Don't miss this!! | I have dined here three times in 2025, once for a family meal for six  and also for a birthday breakfast and now for Father's Day lunch. On each occasion the service has been excellent with varied menus to suit most tastes and pockets. It is not expensive given the high quality of the food. The presentation is truly excellent. Definitely value for money. Staff are very friendly, welcoming and attentive, managing a late booking for us on Father's Day, which was much appreciated. Booking is recommended, particularly on occasions and at weekends. This restaurant is a gem. Very well worth a visit. Yet another satisfying lunch in October. My friend had the monkfish with jalfrezi sauce and rice and loved it. I had the same meal as before ( pork belly and pear frangipane tart) which was delicious and just as good as first time around. Coming back soon with son and daughter in law for lunch. A winner every time.
Ryan's Bar & Restaurant is a Mexican restaurant in Belfast. Customer reviews say: Two words, EXCEPTIONAL VALUE!  Me and the wife were here for a Sunday meal. I had the chicken wings to start and she had cheesy garlic bread with hot honey, very good all round! Main courses were the pork belly roast and fish and chips for me. No complaints here too, all good quality food. Our two courses and two large Pepsi Max was -ú37, you couldnGÇÖt beat it with a big stick! Will defo be back. | Great food at a very reasonable price.    We did the 2 course meal for -ú15 which included a started and a main, or a main and a dessert.  My wife had the porkchop main and a banoffee pie for desert, and chose the chicken wings and pie of the day that was a chicken chorizo and bacon. Everything was tasty and excellent... and large portions. We were both stuffed. | The meal was better than I expected, to be honest.   Especially given the reasonable pricing.   The seafood chowder was served piping hot and was thick and fresh tasting.  The brisket rigatoni was delicious.   Plenty of beef in the dish and the sauce was slightly sweet.   Didn't have a dessert because the servings were enough.   Would return. | Started off on the wrong foot I ordered a coke and didn't ask for a pint of coke. The chicken wings were probably the saving grace you know they will be good here. My chicken curry was totally bland with little to no flavour whatsoever it was a massive disappointment. I finished with the meringue stacks and compote which were nice but not enough to win me over after my main was so poor. The service was also extremely slow for a Sunday night | Embarrassing!  Went on Saturday evening for a meal and had called up prior to check some dietary requirements for gluten free items.. I was told a list of items that werenGÇÖt marked could be altered. Upon ordering I informed the server I had called earlier and the item I wanted was agreed to be made to suit, then when she brought the food she set it to me and I knew the bap on the burger wasnGÇÖt gluten free and was told before I even spoke that my meal wasnGÇÖt gluten free as I never requested it.. but I hadnGÇÖt even asked yet if it was definitely suitable for me.. the server knew she hadnGÇÖt noted the requirement when originally informed and had obviously tried to pass it off as my fault.. then told me chips arenGÇÖt suitable either and another server then interrupted and offered to just remove the bap and that chips were definitely ok even though she said thereGÇÖs contamination in the fryer but no one had ever had a problem before with eating them so itGÇÖs ok.. as a coeliac this isnGÇÖt how cross contamination works if itGÇÖs present it will affect the person and the staff need a serious amount of training on this issue if youGÇÖre going to offer the gluten free service.. having the risk as gluten items are in the premises is one thing and different as itGÇÖs expected but to say that even though thereGÇÖs definitely contamination but itGÇÖs ok.. this is wrong and very misleading. The embarrassment came from the servers being loud while discussing the issue with several other tables all looking to see what was going on, wouldnGÇÖt hurry back and couldnGÇÖt wait to leave especially with getting dirty looks from the staff.
Teddy's Bar & Grill is a Mexican restaurant in Belfast. Customer reviews say: Lovely little bar in Bangor. Parking is a tad difficult but a side street does the job and no need for a parking ticket either.  Food was excellent and was brought out quickly. Service initially was a tad slow but not enough to hinder the experience. The area we were in for food was quiet enough but definitely seemed like a lot of life in the next room (maybe the main bar area?)  Anywho, would highly recommend for a feed. We got 2 courses for -ú19 each on a Saturday night and was very happy with that.  Fish was absolutely fantastic and a great homemade curry to go along with it. Salt and chilli beef to start was great too, not chewy at all and full of flavour.  Would highly recommend | Two year old toddler's  birthday lunch =ƒÿï  good food and service - kids ate "free" could recommend for families with children =ƒÿè.  Parking,  not a problem,  carpark across the street , pay and display,  FREE on Sunday. Overall a great lunch- kid's loved it . | Very nice chowder although the mussel shells were broken in pieces I had to dig out. Triple meat roast dinner was excellent with some of the nicest roast beef and gammon I've had in long time. Tender and flavourful. | Visited today (11th Oct) and were both very, very impressed with the service, good & price. We unfortunately didnGÇÖt get the name of our waitress, but she was absolutely fantastic! Very friendly. We went for a chicken & bacon stack & rump steak. Both cooked to perfection & we cleared the plates. We couldnGÇÖt believe how reasonably priced it was. Will be coming back! | Ate here when hotel kitchen was closed. Nice welcome and prompt service. Food was tasty and well priced. Super quick service.
Boojum - Victoria Square is a Mexican restaurant in Belfast. Customer reviews say: A really good chain of Mexican fast food. The burrito was great tasting and the shear size of it was great. The service was efficient and friendly and I would definitely visit again. | This was the first place we went to eat on our first night in Belfast and it was incredibly underwhelming. Not the staffs fault who were friendly to us, but very cold burrito and rice box not so pleasant. =ƒºè=ƒºè Reason could be we went hour halfish before closing time but if your still open I think quality  should still be there. | Food was meh they really skimp on meat & veg & just overfill the burrito with rice.  Im probably not gonna go back. | Disappointing given what Boojum used to be like. This is my first time visiting the Victoria Square restaurant, and the food was fairly bland. Maybe just a consequence of being a much bigger franchise than it used to be. | Boojum was my absolute favourite back in 2016-2019 whilst studying at University in the city. Since then, your quality has severely decreased and portions have become stingy. I recall my burrito bowl bursting at the seams however now, it is a pathetic portion. I have since moved to Australia and returned for Christmas, was so excited for my first Boojum in almost 2 years! I can confirm that Boojum was my last! Spend your money elsewhere!
Pica is a Mexican restaurant in Belfast. Customer reviews say: It didnGÇÖt miss. From the music and atmosphere as soon as we walking in to the staff & drinks right off the bat, elevated cocktails where serious thought has really went into each item on the menu, the flavours of all the margaritas impressed massively.  The food was sensational. There were so many aspects to elevate the food as well. Every single item on the menu was curated exceptionally with paired flavours to contrast beautifully. The presentation of the dishes was great and the service of the food was relatively quick considering how freshly prepared all the food was  To top it off, the homemade salsa was next level  We will be back | Fantastic night here for my birthday. Food was out of this world. Every dish clearly developed to maximize flavour with careful consideration of the textures and with phenomenal salsas and accompaniments. The service was warm, friendly but also efficient and professional. Great atmosphere. We sat at the bar which I love and got to watch the delicious cocktails being expertly crafted. Overall great craic and great food and I'm looking forward to our next opportunity to dine here. | Atmosphere and staff were incredible. Food equally as good. Tried as much as we could on the menu but will be back to try more. CanGÇÖt go wrong with any of the margaritas! Made to perfection everytime! And their take of a Belfast coffee was a class dessert. | Wow! Pica is an amazing experience with incredible food. The house salsas are delicious and are a great accompaniment with many dishes or the tortilla chips.  We had the corn and venison small plates and the Birria and Baja Fish tacos, which we highly recommend! Of course washed down with some of the best margaritas we have ever had.  The staff were lovely and very attentive. This is a must visit if you are looking for an authentic Mexican treat! | We visited Pica in Belfast for our first proper night out since having our daughter, and it couldnGÇÖt have been more special. From the moment we arrived, the host set the tone for the eveningGÇöincredibly personable, genuinely warm, and clearly passionate about making guests feel welcome. When she found out it was our first date night in six months, she surprised us with a glass of Prosecco each. Such a simple gesture, but it meant the world. Since it had been so long, we didnGÇÖt hold back on orderingGÇöand honestly, weGÇÖre glad we didnGÇÖt. The margaritas were divine, beautifully balanced and dangerously easy to drink. Every dish we tried hit the mark: the tacos were packed with flavour, the tostadas crisp and gorgeous, and each plate arrived looking as good as it tasted. Proper comfort, proper craft. We even ended up taking a doggy bag home for the babysitters, who were very grateful. Pica delivered everything we hoped for and more: great food, great drinks, and hospitality that felt heartfelt rather than rehearsed. A perfect spot for a date night, a treat, or any occasion where you want to feel looked after. CanGÇÖt wait to go back. =ƒî«G£¿
La Taqueria Castle Street is a Mexican restaurant in Belfast. Customer reviews say: Flawless! The type of place you want to take someone you have visiting Belfast. CanGÇÖt fault the place. Amazing vegan options. Attentive lovely staff that are genuinely passionate about the food and drinks. Menu is to die for. The cauliflower tacos are so fresh and flavourful. The mushroom tacos feel so good for the soul. This is probably the best place for food in Belfast. | DonGÇÖt be fooled by the understated front of this restaurant, inside is a place bursting with a vibrant atmosphere and delicious food!  I highly recommend the Birria beef tacos and the papitas fritas. The pulled beef paired with the crunchy shells and flavourful bone broth is a perfect combination.  As I am lactose intolerant the option of the vegan cheese on the tacos and the vegan version of the papitas fritas made my experience even better.  The Mezcal margaritas deserve a special mention as they are divine!  I would highly recommend this place. It has become a favourite of ours. | Incredibly delicious, but pricey (itGÇÖs in city centre and has uncommon ingredients, so not over-priced, but be prepared!)  Elotes/Esquites is one of my favourite items on any menu, and theirs doesnGÇÖt disappoint! | Absolutely unreal the food is exceptional the margaritas are delicious and reasonably priced. Atmosphere is great and the service is fantastic. You need to book though even through the week as it's very popular definitely worth it though. | Great food and tequila flight =ƒÖé We got the pork tacos, chicken tacos and the birria tacos plus a chicken quesadilla. My fave were the pork tacos! Service was great, only two staff members working and it was busy but they provided a service with a smile throughout. Thanks
Urban Fire is a Mexican restaurant in Belfast. Customer reviews say: Went for breakfast and it was amazing, the potato bread stack is 10/10. Service was brilliant and stayed for cocktails which were gorgeous. Caoimhe is also a brilliant host! Really recommend. Outside is very nice to sit and enjoy your drink after food | Our first visit but not our last. From start to finish we had a great experience this evening. The food was amazing, portions sizes were huge. Big thank you to Kathryn for her first class service and her chat, she was so lovely Gÿ¦n+Å Thank you again Kathryn | Visited Urban Fire during our stay in Belfast and was hands down one of the best restaurants we've visited in years. The food was perfectly cooked, the restaurant was very clean with a great decor, and the staff we're extremely friendly and helpful.  We didn't book and just turned up around 8pm without realising they close at 8.30pm, the staff wasn't pushy at all and didn't even make it known they were closing soon, they happily let us eat our food and leave when we had finished around 8.50pm. It was only when we were sitting in the car outside we realised they were closing. Thanks for the amazing food and being so welcoming, if we ever come back to Belfast we'll be sure to visit again. | Food was absolutely amazing!! Got the smash burger n garlic and parmesan fries with a side of pepper sauce! Not just my meal but my company said there food was amazingGÇª safe to say all clean plates Smashing pint of coors is always a bonus  The Staff to top our experience off was amazing so welcoming, our server caoimhe  so friendly n helpful.  Definitely will be back 10/10 | Went to Urban Fire for my birthday and wowGÇª unreal from start to finish.  Had the Hot Sicilian pizza and it was next level. Proper heat, insane flavour the kind of pizza that ruins all other pizzas for you afterwards.  Nicola deserves her own review. She was over the top in the best possible way full birthday energy, top-tier service, and genuinely made the night feel special. You can tell she actually cares, which is rare these days.  Brought the family along and every single one of them loved it (miracles do happen). Food was unreal , service was elite, vibes were spot on.  10/10. Will be back. Might bring a cake next time just to see Nicola go again =ƒÄé=ƒöÑ=ƒìò
Jersey Street Grill is a Mexican restaurant in Belfast. Customer reviews say: A good spot to dine in if you find yourself in the area! Our order consisted of the Big Mac Daddy burger (12 oz), the Hickory burger (12 oz), chicken nuggets with curly fries for the little one, two Diet Cokes, and one strawberry milkshake. Each burger was served with a side of your choice; we opted for the chunky fries and garlic and chili fries, both of which were absolutely delicious and well-seasoned. The double beef patties in the burgers made them a bit challenging and messy to eat, as things tended to fall apart as you took a bite. The order took nearly 30 minutes to arrive (expect a longer wait if the place is crowded). Having the meal around 2:30 pm kept me satisfied for the rest of the day! | Very disappointed with the food. Something as basic as fish and chips shouldn't be hard to get right. The chips were very good but the fish was awful. The fish itself was literal mush and slop inside the batter. I did complain to the waitress when asked if everything was okay but she walked off which I found odd.  When paying the waitress proceeded to ask me two more times if everything was okay, told her it wasn't and she just responded with "Yeah alright".  Shame. Seems to be typical of the Dino Diners brand at the minute. | Great place for food though it was a bit slow turning up. Tasty food and reasonably priced.  Staff friendly and helpful.  All in all I would definitely recommend. | called in for breakfast six of us my first time there and have to say wont be my last be in few more times. Girl served us was great very polite, friendly. My fry was banging really enjoyed it. Rest of us loved the breakfast. My two nephews one got chicken nuggents, chips and left nothing. Other got lasagna and chlps (yes for breakfast =ƒÿü=ƒÿü) he ate the lot to. Great price as well with coffees, tea, juice. We will be regulars now loved it. | For the prices in the menu was expecting more. Not bad, but nothing special. The service and the atmosphere were alright.
Pottingers Cafe Belfast is a Mexican restaurant in Belfast. Customer reviews say: I been this place yesterday. I ordered and took my seat. I felt too smoke inside the cafe, getting difficulty breathing. but I already ordered, so I waited. Smoke smell was coming from my clothes even after I left the cafe. I felt too embarrassed at my office. When food arrived, the poached egg wasn't  soft. It was almost like boil egg. They also forgot chillie oil. I wouldn't go to this place again | Had the belfast fry for lunch. Fortunately they were out of black pudding item, but the meal was very generous and very tasteful. The iced coffee was good. | My favourite wasn't on beef cheeks but gave me change ro try something else, chicken parmigiano,  fantastic,  great venue | Looking for the authentic Irish experience and Morning Star delivered. Steak and Guinness pie was delicious and filling. Staff was friendly and attentive. Atmosphere was lively and ehat youGÇÖd envision from an Irish pub. | Perfect atmosphere, busy with being left to our own world and able to still have a conversation. Food was perfect, both ordered the steak with veg and champ =ƒæî would recommend. Servers were so professional and polite. Would recommend. Great Guinness
Pizza Punks Belfast is a Mexican restaurant in Belfast. Customer reviews say: This place was awesome. From the cool vibes to the great choices of food and drink. Our server Graeme helped guide us and the pizza was perfection. Don't miss the Tuscan sausage,  broccoli and red onion pizza... amazing combination and the crust was perfection.  A can't miss for a great evening. | We were visiting Belfast for the day and stumbled across Pizza Punks mid afternoon on a weekday. It was quiet but the pizza wood fired oven was ready to go. Our server was very friendly and professional. Cool, quirky decor. The pizza was incredible. Possibly the best weGÇÖve ever had including at home (Canada), and travelling in the UK and even Italy and Austria. Super thin crust, plentiful toppings, great flavour and balance. We will be back on our next trip to NI. | Food and drinks were so nice! Drumstick cocktail is amazing & the pizzas are lovely! Waiters were fab and very attentive and helpful! 10/10 | Pizza Punks is a pizzeria, centrally located in the cathedral quarter. We booked here to see what the vegan options were like as we had not visited in quite a few years. We had the vegan meatball pizza and built our own, adding the vegan pepperoni for protein. I would say the meatballs are stand out and super flavourful, so would advise anyone to try them out first. I enjoyed the vegan pepperoni but the meatballs were a tough act to follow! The vegan cheese is also really enjoyable, striking a good balance between consistency and strength. I also love the dough as it is not very greasy or too thick. Overall I would say the pizza is very tasty and for vegans you have some strong options to keep you coming back. My only criticism would be around service times, it seems like they need more staff or maybe even an app. This would help to get things moving quickly. For example our food came out before our drinks, which shows there is a disconnect somewhere in the process! I would definitely advise coming here if you are in the mood for some delicious pizza with some unorthodox toppings =ƒÿè | Brilliant pizza, fantastic service! The sour dough base is crisp and tasty, the toppings are generous. The staff are attentive and very friendly. We'll definitely be back
Banbha is a Mexican restaurant in Belfast. Customer reviews say: A small traditional Irish caf+¬ with the biggest charm. The food is absolutely gorgeous fresh, comforting and full of flavour. The service is warm, attentive and genuinely friendly, the girls could not do enough. ItGÇÖs the kind of place that makes you feel like youGÇÖve stepped into a home rather than a caf+¬. Highly recommend | IGÇÖm so delighted I discovered Banbha.  I ordered a cappuccino with oat milk and it was so good I had to order another.  For my breakfast I ordered a small Irish breakfast- WOW! The ingredients were all top quality and locally sourced- best of the best!  Finally, Bernie is the best! SheGÇÖs so so lovely. Even took time to explain about the artwork to me. SheGÇÖs a credit to the business.  I will be back. | Just popped in for some lunch today. My wife had the mexican club sandwich with a bowl of chips and I had the french toast with bacon. Both were delicious. Great value for money! | Tried today for the first time and the food was delicious. I got a Mexican sourdough toastie and my boyfriend got the buffalo chicken sourdough toastie and both were gorgeous and very fresh. The sourdough bread is to die for. Light and crispy. Will definitely be back. | Top quality food in a welcoming atmosphere. "Small" fry was generous and the club sandwich really tasty. My kids were kindly gifted a gorgeous brownie each on their way out! We'll definitely be back
Belfast Empire Music Hall is a Mexican restaurant in Belfast. Customer reviews say: I was back in the Empire for the first time in over twenty years and what a nostalgia trip it was!  I did not realise that they served food now and I must admit that I was very pleasantly surprised by the quality of it.  We had fish and chips, the Empire Burger and the Mexican Chilli Chicken burger, all with generous portions of chips or wedges.  We were all very impressed. I had the chicken burger and it was so tasty!  As we ate, we were entertained by the talented Jackie Rainy.  Her acoustic set was just perfect and not loud which meant we could still have a conversation and enjoy the music at the same time.  Overall we had a great time in the Empire and we would be very keen to return soon and do it all again! | Saw the magic numbers play here last night. Brilliant gig. First time in the upstairs music hall, lovely venue. It has lots of character, well laid out with some seating along the balcony with great view of the stage. Can't wait for my next gig here =ƒñù | Really disappointed tonight by the Empire.  WeGÇÖve really enjoyed the music in the bar for a long time now, and we have been visiting more often since they put on their student offer.  We especially love listening to Jackie and Emma on Fridays.  As a few friends, we have been buying a round each and enjoying the music regularly.  Unfortunately tonight after a few rounds, ?the manager? decided this wasnGÇÖt the case and overcharged my little brother, a young student. I had went up to explain and showed all of our student cards. I received a rude explanation of these new rules, all of a sudden. The poorest customer service I have experienced.  I never leave reviews but tonight was disappointing for a regular customer.  Would leave, but weGÇÖve just spent our hard earned cash on their pints. | Amazing venue for gigs. Good views in the whole place. I would recommend going to any gig here. The sound is great too. Also great pints on draft. | I would go as far to say that the bar staff whilst all lovely REALLY need training. What ever happened to someone taking an area of the bar. Wondering around like lost ducks. Im writing this having waited twice for drink for over 1 hour on a not so busy night. Someone give these guys some direction, great venue, SHIT SERVICE!
the pocket is a Mexican restaurant in Belfast. Customer reviews say: Loved this place!  The food and service was great.  We arrived early following a flight and so managed to grab a table however about 15/20 minutes later the place was packed with a queue.  The food was delicious and generous portions. I am not normally a sweet tooth but went for the tropical French toast and it did not disappoint! The stack was also well cooked and well flavoured.  I liked the light atmosphere in the space. | Really enjoyed our visit to The Pocket, it felt super cozy. The vibe is relaxed but stylish. I had the Chicken French Toast, and it was perfect: fresh, flavorful, and beautifully presented. My husband had the Chicken Bombay Hash, which was perfectly spiced, and the bhajis were a highlight. We went on a weekend, so we had to queue for a bit over 45 minutes, but once seated, the service was fast and not rushed. ItGÇÖs definitely on the pricier side, but worth it for a treat. | Delicious breakfast brunch, we had the Pocket Fry and the Chorizo Brunch and we were so amazed by how gorgeous it was. The service was warm & welcoming. We had to wait for a table but it was so worth it to be able to eat this! 10/10 recommend! | Popped in for breakfast during a child free stay in the city. Service from David was amazing, so helpful and kind. The food, yummy, so good! I had the confit duck hash that is only served on weekends - to die for! The little tea timers were a cute touch! | This place has been on my list for a while, and we finally made it. When we arrived, there was a queue outside and it took over half an hour to get a table. It was absolutely freezing. I donGÇÖt usually wait in queues GÇö thatGÇÖs a big no for me GÇö but we were already there, so we waited.  And it paid off.  Once inside, the place was warm and cozy, which felt incredible after standing in the cold. We ordered two cappuccinos, and they were excellent GÇö properly hot and really well made.  My husband ordered the fried chicken waffle, and I had the sourdough with mushrooms and two poached eggs, plus two beef sausages on the side. That was a standout for me. You rarely see beef sausages offered; itGÇÖs almost always pork or vegetarian, and I donGÇÖt eat pork, so this was a big win.  Our daughter had French toast with honey and raspberry jam, and we also ordered her a hot chocolate (not pictured). Everything we ordered was excellent. The flavors were incredible and the portions were massive.  The bill came to around -ú50, and it matched the experience. The food lived up to the hype. One thing to note: the space is a little cramped, and the tables are quite close together.  Overall, a very strong spot. We will definitely be coming back again =ƒÖî=ƒÅ+=ƒñ¬
Tortilla Belfast is a Mexican restaurant in Belfast. Customer reviews say: My first time trying here and I ordered a vegetarian burrito bowl, even though I'm not a strict vegetarian any more. WOW! The container was full to the brim, everything was so fresh and full of flavour - even the rice, which I sometimes feel is just a 'filler' in these types of dishes. It blows the local 'burrito big-boy' (Boojum) out of the water imho. I can't wait to try other items on their exciting menu.  The staff too were equally awesome as they helped me access my online purchase in order to 'collect' it cos my phone battery had died.  Honestly, try out this place! | I have been to the Glasgow airport restaurant a few times, but never the Belfast city centre one and I wasn't disappointed!  Both me and my wife opted for quesadillas as Tacos were unfortunately out of stock,  being my wife's first time trying this style of food, she was slightly disappointed, but when our meals arrived, she was very pleased with the flavours!  Staff were very friendly, a great atmosphere when you walk in the door and doesn't feel like a chain restaurant but doesn't feel like a small corner venue either.  Seating was a bit short on it, so we decided to sit outside considering it was a nice day and there are always some buskers in the square to provide entertainment.  Will definitely be back. | Tortilla in Belfast absolutely delivered. The flavours were insane GÇö bold, fresh, and exactly what you want from a proper Mexican spot. The portions were generous, and the prices were incredibly reasonable for what you get. Overall, amazing and definitely worth a visit! =ƒñ¬=ƒÖî=ƒÅ+ | The food itGÇÖs so good. As a burrito expert. This is hands down the best burrito in Belfast. I like to come here whenever I am in town for a quick hearty lunch. Team as so lovely too! Coming back soon! | If IGÇÖm in Belfast this is where I go to have a guaranteed tasty meal. I love it here so much and the service is always great! Thank you to Alba for making the best burrito bowl ever.
Madame Pho is a Mexican restaurant in Belfast. Customer reviews say: To find good pho in the UK is like to find water in a desert. And let's be fair, one would not expect to find a great one in Belfast. But we did. We went there about 3 months ago and still had to write a review. The soup is quite tasty and on top of that the ingredients are so fresh - beef pho is a must. Look, I am not saying it is like what's in Vietnam (which by the way, if you haven't been, you must go at least for the original pho), but it's brilliant enough here. Coffee is delicious too. The service was also nice and attentive. I'd visit Belfast again just for Madame Pho in a heartbeat. Good restaurants can turn bad, I just hope this one doesn't! | My friend said itGÇÖs a must, so I gave it a shot. Arrived there on fumes, a bit hangry. Generally speaking, I donGÇÖt even like Pho that much.  The welcome staff was absolutely lovely. Pho itself? Absolutely mind blown! Clearest broth IGÇÖve ever seem, yet the most flavorful and fragrant IGÇÖve ever come across. Definitely 10/10.  Note: prepare yourself some cash, card/contactless not accepted here. | Honestly it was so good! The salted wongs might be the best ever. Pho soup was also great! Definitely a must stop | Best food IGÇÖve had the entire time IGÇÖve been in Ireland. The broth was rich and light and flavorful. 10/10 recommend coming here. The only picture I could take was after eating because I inhaled it. | Authentic pho with a rich, comforting broth and fresh herbs, very satisfying and full of flavour. Loved the rice dish too: juicy girlled prawn and pork neck skewers, crispy spring roll, and the rice with fried egg was simple but comforting. Everything tasted fresh and well-made. The only downside is the shop is very small, so dining in feels a bit tight. Still a great spot for authentic food, especially for a quick meal or takeaway
Pie Eyed is a Mexican restaurant in Belfast. Customer reviews say: I had their Chicken Leek pie and the Mexican Beef Birria pie. SOO GOOD. Both pies were flavorful. The spiciness on the beef birria one was perfect. I could drink the birria sauce by itself. As a Mexican living here, I miss mexican food, but they got the flavor spot on. Conner was a nice fellow too. Look forward to try another pie next time. | Lovely pies! I normally go for chips with my pie, but the mash and gravy were surprisingly delicious. | Have had their pies several times now at their pop up in the the Court House Bangor and have really enjoyed them and I'm not normally a big fan of pies. Particularly enjoyed the satay chicken one and my wife loves the cauliflower cheese one. Great that you can also get them chilled to take home and make later in the week with instructions on reheating | Amazing flavour, great service. 3 pies in 3 weeks - beef, lamb and xmas special. All equally tasty! Thanks Conor for sorting us out!! | I'm so impressed by the portion sizes.The chicken and leek pie is absolutely gorgeous with the perfect amount of filling vs crust.  I would love to see a sweet pie next.
El Keto Burrito is a Mexican restaurant in Belfast. Customer reviews say: Stunning food, the beef on the taco chips was unbelievable. Highly recommended. Cheaper, nicer and bigger portions than the other Mexican in town. | Fast service , excellent food GÇª Burrito bowl was really tasty | Very very poor. No flavour from anything we tried, over cooked rice, was so over cooked it was gloopy and stuck to the bottom of the bowl... The chicken was pretty much just Boiled chicken unseasoned, at a guess it's just the chicken that's used for the sandwiches during the day as it's a cafe during the day Mexican at night. Jack of all trades master of none springs to mind. Lukewarm food n that's being kind, the sauces appear to be straight from a Santa Maria bottle. If I wanted terrible Mexican food I'd buy my own Santa Maria kit from Asda.  Sorry guys very very underwhelmed.
Platito by Mangan is a Mexican restaurant in Belfast. Customer reviews say: Dining at Platito by Mangan is nothing short of an experience that warms both the heart and soul. The food is absolutely stellar GÇö each dish is prepared with such authenticity that it instantly transported me back home to the Philippines. The flavors are rich, comforting, and deeply familiar, evoking memories of family meals and celebrations shared with loved ones. Beyond the incredible food, what truly elevates the experience is the exemplary service. The staff go above and beyond to make you feel welcome, cared for, and at home GÇö just as if you were being hosted by family. Their attentiveness and genuine warmth add an extra layer of comfort to the meal, making it so much more than just dining out. Platito by Mangan is more than a restaurant; itGÇÖs a reminder that even when far away, home can be found in a plate of food and in the kindness of people who serve it. | Celebrated my HusbandGÇÖs birthday with Platito by Mangan, this is our first time eating in Filipino Restaurant in Belfast and this is the best decision=ƒÑ¦. Complete package Gÿ¦n+Å the ambiance, food and most specially their service =ƒÆ», Thank you Madam from Baguio for going extra mile with your service. They made our day extra special =ƒñù. Will surely be back grabe yung food sobrang sarap po =ƒÿè. | It was an on the spot booking for a dine in table. They were fully booked on our desired time but was booked on an earlier slot which is pretty fine. The owner was very accommodating and friendly. Asked us how was the food and if we were comfortable with our seats, and we were definitely. Leaving the shop with our stomach full and 100% satisfied. We miss our food in the Philippines and Platito by Mangan absolutely filled our missing hearts. We'll be back soon!!!! | I had an amazing experience at Platito by Mangan here in Belfast Northern Ireland. They truly brought the flavors of the northern part of the Philippines all the way to the northern part of Ireland. The moment I tasted their classic beef pares, it instantly reminded me of home. The rich savory taste is exactly how we enjoy it in the Philippines and it is definitely one of the best versions I have tried outside the country.  They also offer many more Filipino dishes that showcase the comfort and authenticity of our cuisine. I am excited to come back and try the rest of their menu because I really miss the taste of real Filipino food.  The place is very neat with a warm and welcoming ambiance. The decorations and overall setup make you feel relaxed and comfortable while dining. You can see the love and effort put into creating a place where Filipinos and locals alike can enjoy good food and good vibes.  Highly recommended for anyone looking for an authentic Filipino dining experience in Belfast. I will surely be back. | First time trying Filipino food, very satisfied! The staff were super accommodating and friendly. Ordered the adobo and intestinesGÇöboth very tasty, especially with the cucumber drink, very refreshing. Portions are meant for two people, but honestly I could finish it alone.  They also have vegetarian options, so it was nice to come with friends and everyone could eat something. The vibe was great, prices reasonable, and the food was well made. Overall very happy with the experience, would come back again.
Waterman House is a Mexican restaurant in Belfast. Customer reviews say: We were at a seafood and fish cookery course today, hosted by Niall and Claire. We were taught how to cook 4 dishes. The amount of detail in the course was fantastic, once we cooked each dish we sat down at a family style table and ate each dish, accompanied with wine. Niall and Claire were really engaging and so knowledgeable, I honestly left feeling I could cook those four dishes competently myself and I'm no cook! I highly recommend this to anyone. Such good fun! | This month I and a few friends attended the Cookery School at Waterman House for a bread making course.  As I'm not very good at anything in the kitchen I was super worried about how I'd cope with making bread from scratch.  Turns out I'm OK at it, although I am going to say that was down to the very welcoming and supportive host Claire. She guided us all through the various breads.  We made 4 different loaves as well as 2 batches of Pizza dough each. Each person was able to make there own individual pizza, shown how to roll out the base and encouraged to load that bad boy up with as many toppings as we'd like. We each then sat and ate our beautiful pizza and sipped on a glass a wine to finish the session.  I can honestly say it was good fun and I learned a lot. I will definitely go back and do another masterclass. The list of classes available varied.  Thanks so much to all at Waterman House | Got a voucher to go to the French food and wine pairing night at waterman cookery school and it was brilliant. Niall was great, instructed really clearly and was great to listen to as he talked through things. The wine was really nice and the food was the best IGÇÖve ever made and IGÇÖll definitely be using the recipeGÇÖs again. I made an onion and thyme tatin, chocolate mousse and creamy chicken leg with a cheese sauce | We did a class at the cookery school and it was fantastic! Clare is a wonderful teacher, the class was engaging and fun, and we got lots of treats to take home with us. The group size isnGÇÖt too large so there is plenty of opportunity for everybody to ask questions or receive guidance where necessary. We will definitely be coming back for more classes | Brilliant time. Niall and Claire both brilliant chefs, surprisingly patient for being chefs tho. Ingredients where so good. Everything was very well organised. Not only the cooking experience but avn the craic and explaining the importance of why how n when of the day. Definitely would advise anyone to go do the experience.
McKees Farm Shop is a Mexican restaurant in Belfast. Customer reviews say: This is a destination farm shop.  The variety of food available is outstanding.  They have everything from fresh veg and meat to pies, ready meals and baked goods.  There's even an old fashioned sweet shop!  (Check the photos). We had lunch in the restaurant which was really good and probably worth the visit alone.  The view from the restaurant, over Strangford Lough and Scarborough tower was impressive.  Overall, McKees is worth a visit even if you're not local.  I'll definitely be back at some point. | Absolutely amazing place to go. Food is delicious in the restaurant with huge portions all at a very good price. The selection in the store, both gifts & food, is great with so much to choose from - I always come out with far more than planned! Flower tubs & plants are extremely reasonably priced. CanGÇÖt recommend this farm shop highly enough! =ƒîƒ=ƒîƒ=ƒîƒ=ƒîƒ=ƒîƒ | An absolute gem, such a lovely cafe with nice coffee and lovely breakfast options, will have to try out their lunch menu and the farm shop is full of lovely food options, never had a bad purchase. Would highly recommend their chicken and steak pies. | We stumbled upon this farm shop as we were staying nearby for the weekend. Wow! We were so blown away by how many wonderful items there were in the shop, with so many locally grown/made. We were only sad that we donGÇÖt live closer because we would love to shop here regularly. | Great variety of meat, fruit n veg and bakery products. Together with some gift items. Lovely restaurant and very pleasant and helpful staff
Mr Snak is a Mexican restaurant in Belfast. Customer reviews say: Absolutely incredible food and incredible staff highly recommend the taco mix box and the toasties are to die for best tacos in the country | Very delicious food. Got the birria tacos and the beef chips. Food is freshly cooked and get it as is so delicious and a lot of food. The photos donGÇÖt do the place justice itGÇÖs a 10/10 | I have never tasted nicer takeaway food than this place!! Their mince tacos are amazing =ƒññ iv been addicted ever since tasting them. Haven't ordered a Chinese from i started eating from here. Food comes freshly made and hot. Delivery also fast and very reasonably priced. Thank you mr snak for the great food. | The nicest staff and delicious food, my son is the fussiest eater and he loves the loaded fries with taco sauce. The beef tacos are so nice. The food is made up fresh which makes it so much better than other places. I have fussy children and the staff are always happy to make amendments to dishes for them.  I Definitely recommend Mr Snak =ƒæî | Food is sooo tasty !!! Best takeaway in the area! The burritos, taco fries and milkshakes are exceptional. So happy I found this place. Service is great, they make sure you get exactly what you want. 10/10 experience every time.
The Bookshelf at The Elysian is a Mexican restaurant in Cork. Customer reviews say: Great spot for a takeout coffee and pastry. Coffee is very good and the pastries IGÇÖve tried have all been delicious. I havenGÇÖt tried the full menu yet, but I look forward to it. ThereGÇÖs a nice seating area and an upstairs (I think with seating too?). There is some outdoor seating as well. Definitely stop in if youGÇÖre in the area. | We arrived at the end of a busy Sunday service. It was a bit hectic with lots of items missing off the menu. I don't think this is the usual experience so I'll need to visit again to compare. Nonetheless, the food was really good. We ordered the breakfast bap and the avocado and toast. The avocado and eggs in particular was great. The addition of the peanut and sesame rayu made it extra special (we even bought a jar when we were leaving). | I've been living in Cork for a while, often passing by The Bookshelf. The exterior always caught my attention, as it is very beautiful and well decorated. For my birthday, I decided to make a reservation and... I couldn't have chosen better! =ƒì+  You have plenty of options on the menu. We opted for the Avo & Eggs, which was exquisite. If you order it, be aware that the Rayu is spicy; you can request it on the side if spice isn't your thing. We also ordered the Korean Chicken BurgerGÇölooks spectacular, tastes even better.  The service was super friendly. Before leaving, Mark thanked us for choosing the restaurant and invited us to come back. We'll definitely return! Thank you very much G£¿=ƒÿè | I did not like the coconut milk cappuccino it was not as i expected..  They offer gluten free cake options .. | Food was lovely. I had the eggs Benedict. Service was excellent. Staff is lovely in there. Upstairs atmosphere not great but it might just have been the time of day.
The Quays Bar & Restaurant is a Mexican restaurant in Cork. Customer reviews say: 5/5 GÇô Exceptional Experience at a Seafront Gem  We can't thank Noel and his team enough for providing an outstanding three-course lunch for our group of 60. From the moment we arrived, we were greeted with warm hospitality and refreshing welcome drinks. Noel and his staff went above and beyond to make sure the afternoon ran smoothly, with impeccable service and attention to detail throughout.  The food was absolutely deliciousGÇöpiping hot, flavorful, and served flawlessly, even for such a large group. Every course was a hit with our guests, and it's clear that the kitchen takes pride in the quality and presentation of each dish.  Noel was incredibly accommodating, communicating with us well in advance of our arrival to ensure everything was perfect. His professionalism and friendly demeanor made planning a breeze, and it truly showed in the seamless execution of the event.  The restaurant itself is in a fantastic location right on the seafront in Cobh, making it an ideal spot whether you're stopping by with family or hosting a business event. We can't recommend it highly enough!  Thank you, Noel and team, for an unforgettable afternoon and the exceptional service! WeGÇÖll definitely be back. | Great location, great view .. nice view of cruise ship .. steak was well done while i asked for medium done chewy.. pasta was nice.. Staff response is not friendly.. not easy to get attention. | Stopped off for a quick drink while waiting for our train in Cobh (its a one minute walk from the station). The staff were friendly and atmosphere nice. We sat outside and had a lovely view of the bay and the huge cruise ship that had anchored there. Definitely recommended. | Service great! Atmosphere great! Food not that much! Ordered a steak, requested it rare, came to the table well done. The steak looked like it was cooked on a George Foreman electric grill or some Lidl grill. For 34.50Gé¼ was expecting much more.Chips were very dry on the inside and had a weird taste. Mush peas looked like they were done 2 weeks ago. Asparagus were raw, felt like i was eating a stick from the tree. Will not be coming back. | Very underwhelming meal. The chips were dry, pale, and oddly chunky GÇö more like half-boiled potatoes than proper chips. No crisp, no flavor, just disappointing. The pizza didnGÇÖt redeem things either: bland, and lacking any real taste or texture. For the price, I expected something much better.
Liberty Grill is a Mexican restaurant in Cork. Customer reviews say: It was a good experience. This is a great brunch in town. Our dishes, the open chicken sandwich, the Irish Benedict, and the chocolate and cranberry French toast were delicious. I highly recommend this place if you want to be sure of a really good option for lunch or brunch in Cork. The value for money was suitable. | My experience at Liberty Grill was absolutely wonderful. The service was excellentGÇöthe staff was incredibly attentive, professional, and made the entire meal feel special.  The food was also top-notch. Everything we ordered was prepared to perfection and tasted absolutely delicious. It's clear that they use high-quality ingredients and take great pride in their cooking.  I can't recommend Liberty Grill enough. It's a fantastic spot for a meal in the heart of Cork, and I'll definitely be returning. | Food was delicious and fresh. They had so many great options so it was very hard to choose! | We had a lovely dinner at this place on Saturday, the food was delicious, and also the staff were friendly as well! Love they gave us some surprise for our anniversary dinner! Highly recommended! | One of the better meals we ate in Ireland. Staff were friendly and helpful, they easily accommodated our kid with a high chair and kids menu with crayons, and the food was delicious.
Oak Fire Pizza is a Mexican restaurant in Cork. Customer reviews say: Oak Fire Pizza Douglas is the best pizza place around GÇö always our first choice! Emma and her team are so welcoming and make you feel right at home. The pizzas are absolutely delicious GÇö our go-tos are the New Yorker, BBQ Chicken, and Vegetarian. Full of flavor and perfectly cooked. They also offer great gluten-free and vegan options, which is a big plus. Highly recommend!=ƒÿÇ | St MichaelGÇÖs Tennis Club , Blackrock  We had a pizza party in our tennis club last Friday night for our Closed Tournament. We have used Oak Fire Pizza previously. Emma made it so easy, advising what was popular & how much to order, a pleasure to deal with. Our pizzas were delivered right on time, very fresh , delicious, last time the Carnivore proved very popular & Emma suggested the Hoggi , our members loved that too. So our pizza night was a great success & could only recommend Oak Fire Pizza. Thank you Emma & team Sent from my iPhone | Wish they would add a gluten free option on their Deliveroo as I don't spend enough to qualify for their own delivery! Always have to collect if want the gluten free pizza, which is lovely! | IGÇÖve been a customer for many years we have always enjoyed oak fire in the resturant and as takeaway. I was recently there on a weekend night, they were really busy! I asked the wait time for takeaway but it was too long as we were under major pressure. We decided we would sit in and hope that the pizza would be quicker that way and because we were out of options of places to go that would be somewhat quick. We hadnGÇÖt had a hot meal in several days. I mentioned when asking the time wait that our newborn baby girl was in the neonatal unit of cumh and we were rushing to eat after collecting clothes for her at home and get back into her as fast as we could. We were on autopilot and sick with worry. What felt like no time at all our pizzas arrived and we were able to take them with us while we drove to the hospital. I thanked the staff members with tears in my eyes, we couldnGÇÖt have been more grateful. She said we got lucky it just went quiet but my gut says otherwise. To all the team at oak fire. Thank you so much, I will never forget it! | I visited oak fire pizza in Douglas for the first time lovely spot! Staff were friendly and the seating area was lovely and warm. The pizza was incredible and I would highly recommend the garlic dip too!
Buns & Dough is a Mexican restaurant in Cork. Customer reviews say: Went here yesterday evening and we got a take away and was so happy with everything. The chips are so good and loved the burger too. Excellent service the staff are so nice and friendly and will definitely be going back to try other stuff on the menu. Would highly recommend:) | Literally stumbled upon Buns & Dough the other night while driving home and I have to say its a hidden gem of a chipper in the Northside of Cork City!  The Staff: The staff are very friendly and they keep the premises spotlessly clean. So much so we thought that they had already prepped to close down for the night however, they were still open for another hour.  The Food: They have a standard chipper menu consisting of various types of burgers, pizzas and chips. We ordered the Hawaiian burger and chips with some curry dip on the side. The Hawaiian burger was fantastic! They add a rasher and a slice of pineapple along with cheese and their house sauce! To be honest I don't think I can order anything else now that I've tried it it was so good! The chips are chunky and freshly cooked to order and their curry sauce was delicious. I already know that I'll be coming back!  Layout: Its a standard chipper with the main counter and ordering area infront of you when you walk in. The order counter and till are to the left and glass hot lamp is to the right of the counter. There is no seating so you can't sit down to eat however, there once had for good.  Note: The only thing I didn't like is that when I asked for a curry chip and for the curry to be on the side they charged an extra euro than the price on the board. It was charged as a regular chip at Gé¼3 plus a side of curry at Gé¼2, where as the "curry chip" on the board is Gé¼4 (I assume the curry is poured over the chips). Its no big deal as I can undersand from a business point of view they need to cover the cost of the tub.  Overall Opinion: If you are in the area of where the Old Youghal Road meets the Ballyhooly Road and looking for a good quality chipper I highly recommend stopping by Buns & Dough! Next time I plan on trying their Curry Cheese Chip and I will be definitely getting the Hawaiian burger again! Solid 8.5 out of 10! | Got a beef burger and taco fries Sunday night on delivero. Have currently spent the last two days with food poising. I had not eaten anything else that day that would have given me food poising. I believe it was the taco fries that gave it due to my partner also having a beef burger and he was fine. | Fairly average food to be honest, I can only comment on what I ordered as I haven't tried anything else. Pizza was ok , chips were not enjoyable at all, they had that soft texture as if they were sitting there for 2 hours, and the wings were ok to. Very underwhelming | So we get this every 2 weeks or so cause the meal was decent value 12:50 for burger topped chips and a can went to order tonight and they now make you add a tub of sauce that we donGÇÖt need or want for Gé¼2 what a scummy way to get your prices up why not make it a euro more or even 1:50 be bareable but Gé¼2 and to add it in through sauce is sneaky and underhanded =ƒñªGÇìGÖén+Å not for me anymore
Burritos and Blues is a Mexican restaurant in Cork. Customer reviews say: Burrito was ok, - Flavorless and cold. But the service / server was horrible. Would not answer my questions or give me time to choose. With so many other choices at the market I choose wrong by going here. It will be the last time though | Please don't buy from here :- I got charged 20 euros for a burrito bowl...the quality and the quantity of items were bad considering the price | Very hostile and aggressive server. Burritos were not heated and flavourless | The burrito was just okayGÇöflavorless and cold. Unfortunately, the service made the experience worse. The server was aggressive, wouldnGÇÖt answer my questions, and didnGÇÖt give me time to decide.  With so many other options in the market, I chose wrong by coming here. It will be my last visit. God they were rude. Lady before me experienced the same .... should have turned on my heels and bolted. | Genuinely the most disappointing food service IGÇÖve had. The server was quite volatile, unhelpful and made me feel really uncomfortable when she started speaking to her colleague about me. I hadnGÇÖt eaten here before so I asked a question about the meat options which was responded to like I was an idiot and a nuisance to them. The meal itself was cold, chewy and lacked flavour. All in all, not worth the price as it was poor service and even worse food. There are plenty of better options in the market - go check them out instead.
Mimmos Take Away is a Mexican restaurant in Cork. Customer reviews say: Fish was nice, it was precooked then finished off as many places do now not perfect but ok. The one thing I didn't like was the 'skinny chips' frozen crappy frys not chip shop chips at all. The curry sauce is a bit strange too more like curry baked bean juice. | Super busy takeout on a holiday weekend.   Their mistake on my order made me wait an additional 15 minutes. Excellent fish, but soggy, not quite done chips.  Appears popular with a younger crowd. | Food was nice, I would like to return to try other things on the menu. But as for that curry sauce never again. It tasted like warm ketchup. It actually took away from the food. | Not great. The southern fried chicken was really nice, but ya can't have frozen chips in a chipper. | The food here is outstanding! Crispy, perfectly cooked fish and chips that were as fresh as it gets. The shop was spotless, and even though we came in late in the evening with a group of 11 people, Antonio handled everything with ease, patience, and a smile.  Before we stopped in, our group was frustrated from a late night issue with our accommodations. Antonio immediately stepped in, took care of us, and completely saved the day from turning into a horrible travel experience. We enjoyed the amazing fish and chips over a pint or two of amazing Guinness across the street.  ItGÇÖs rare to find someone who puts this much heart into both the food and the people. His genuine hospitality turned a stressful night into one of the highlights of our trip. If every business owner was like him, the world would be a better place.
Bocelli Italian Kitchen & Wine Bar is a Mexican restaurant in Cork. Customer reviews say: We came here after we couldn't get in somewhere else because we didn't have reservations. I was happy we were able to get in here and even happier after we ate! It was amazing! The pasta was excellent, steak cooked perfectly, and the dessert was to die for! Everything was excellent and the service was great. I thought they were fast, efficient and very attentive. I am so glad we were able to try this little gem! | We had a very good overall experience at this restaurant. There were six of us, and while we were told we needed to wait for our table to be prepared, which took a bit of time, everything after that went smoothly. We placed quite a large order, and all the dishes arrived promptly.  Everything was tasty, and everyone at our table praised their meals. Personally, I feel I didnGÇÖt make the best choice, I ordered salmon, and it was a bit overcooked and slightly tough, and also completely unsalted, which made it less enjoyable for me. However, the side dish that came with it was absolutely delicious.  One of my friends mentioned that her perch was slightly overcooked, but apart from that, everyone else said their food was truly amazing. Considering the number of dishes we ordered, these are really minor remarks.  The desserts were especially praised, we ordered a selection, and my friends were delighted (I didnGÇÖt try them myself, so I canGÇÖt comment firsthand). The coffee was excellent. | Absolutely loved this place! I didnGÇÖt order a starter, but I had the Surf & Turf, and my boyfriend went for a pizza,  which he said was one of the best in town. As a true meat lover, I can say my dish was simply spectacular perfectly cooked, juicy, and full of flavor.  For dessert, he had either a brownie or a chocolate cake (canGÇÖt remember exactly =ƒÿà) and I ordered the cr+¿me br++l+¬e but he ended up stealing most of mine! Both desserts were fantastic.  We didnGÇÖt have a booking, but the manager was lovely and still managed to fit us in despite how busy the restaurant was on a Monday night. We shared a bottle of wine and finished the night with espresso.  The best part? The bill for two mains, two desserts, wine, and coffee didnGÇÖt even reach Gé¼100 incredible value for the quality and experience.  =ƒôìVerdict: Delicious food, fully recommended! | IGÇÖve been there many many times, me and my best friend always enjoy their pasta and share a nice chocolate fondue for dessert. We keep coming back ever since we discovered it, yet yesterday it mustGÇÖve been our lucky day. I have never had a tagliatelle as lovely as theirs, I ate it within minutes, the portions are quite big and worth the price. The desert was better than ever and it nearly brought me to tears woth the explosion of flavours. The staff was so so nice as always, and Mac Miller was playing in the background. The atmosphere was amazing and I cannot address it enough - every single person should try it out it is purely bliss!!!! | I celebrated my birthday here on October 26th, and it couldnGÇÖt have been more perfect! The atmosphere is so cozy and welcoming, and the dishes are very well served. The whole staff was amazing, super professional and kind. A special thanks to Cristina, the manager, who organized everything to make it such a special night. When it was time for my birthday song, all the staff joined in and even played a song from my country (such a lovely surprise). The food was delicious (special shout-out to the kitchen team. Highly recommend!
Vicarstown Bar is a Mexican restaurant in Cork. Customer reviews say: Please avoid and spend your money elsewhere Before we ordered our last drink we asked the bartender how much drinking up time is allowed and his reply was 30 minutes so we ordered a pint Within 10:Minutes We were been harassed by 3 bouncers I told him politely I was informed I had 30 minutes as the bartender had told me before I ordered my beer. I even asked for a plastic container if they wanted to close early but NO ,Obey the law and be fair , The other negative reviews reflect the same opinions so itGÇÖs actually genuine Maybe we will send some undercover gardai to investigate this and your other bars I would appreciate a reply to this review as we are not letting this go . We will send in different  people with cameras to investigate your policy . Stop ripping people off | Beamish! Neat mural, nice street. We were there on a Saturday midday and kids were playing all around the streets (traffic was shut off). It was lovely! | Security issues Security officer didn't let my friend in and saying he is intoxicated which isn't true. He hasn't been drinking that night at all. When I asked him what the reason is he was like in my opinion he is drunk I said he isn't drunk and he was like he is drunk in my opinion I believe he repeated that 10 times at least. I asked him to call his manager and his answer was there's no manager I figured out after he was the one who is in charge and we believe he just doesn't let people in who didn't like. We believe that because it's the only reason we can think about. This happened on 12th October approximately 1am. I don't recommend this please at all with all respect Thanks =ƒÖÅ | Based in North Main Street in Cork City Center this bar has a nice cosy atmosphere and is popular with all age groups. There is a great selection of beers and the staff are friendly. There's a nice beer garden out the back which is heated in the winter months. | Had to stop in to see "the mural" and fish. There's a cool area out back. On that particular night... Not our crowd. So we left after one drink.
Cissie Youngs is a Mexican restaurant in Cork. Customer reviews say: Brilliant staff, beer, and location! Perfect spot for a quiet pint, a night out in the pub, or a place to watch a match. Numerous guest craft beer taps which change regularly, showcasing the best of Cork beer, as well as some great pics from breweries from further afield. Reasonable prices are the cherry on top! | We enjoyed our experience here. The pizza was good, and the nachos were great. Bartenders David and Amy went out of their way to make us feel welcome. We would happily go back. | Excellent local bar. Great staff and friendly patrons. | Good atmosphere! The resident cocktail maker was not present but the fella behind the bar did his best and produced some top quality cocktails for us. Staff are incredibly sound. | Went there to see a band. Great night had. Great pub, good service
Luigi Malones Cork is a Mexican restaurant in Cork. Customer reviews say: Came here with friends to celebrate my 18th and we had such a great time! =ƒîƒ I had the Cashew Tofu Stir Fry, which was full of flavour with perfectly cooked veggies, and the Toblerone cheesecake, delicious!  The staff were amazing and made the evening extra special by bringing out the cheesecake with a candle and singing happy birthday. It was so kind of them to take the cheesecake off the bill. Thanks for helping make my birthday dinner so memorable! =ƒÆ¢ | Luigi Malones is a fantastic spot with delicious food and warm, friendly service. The cauliflower wings, buffalo wings, and cashew-tofu stir-fry with rice were all outstanding. Dessert and lunch options are impressive, and the mocktails GÇö especially Strawberry Fields GÇö are a treat. Overall, an amazing experience with a lovely, welcoming hostess. | Took a large (and late) booking at very late notice.  They were very accommodating from the off. Fast and friendly service.  Food was delish. No rotisserie but was clear on menu as limited and we did sit late.  All different types of food and everyone really enjoyed. Decent sized portions too.  I do admit having had food envy when I saw the chicken fajitas. Loked smelt abd tasted amazing (I had a  taster...).  Great food, service and atmosphere.  Would highly recommend | They were able to sweeze us in although full. Lovely staff. Very convenient when going to Opera house. Great food. Jad pizza and fajitas, both were delicious. | We go here from time to time as a family and itGÇÖs always a nice experience. The atmosphere is relaxed, the food is consistently good, and the staff are friendly and welcoming. Our daughter really enjoys it too, which makes it an easy place for us to come back to.
Zambrero is a Mexican restaurant in Cork. Customer reviews say: This place has really gone downhill. Its now astronomically expensive. A burrito that used to be 8 euros is now 11.30 and they no longer give the student discount. Its really a shame as the quality is extremely inconsistent with some servers giving more meat than others. Will not be coming by anymore. Places like burritos and blues have far better value for what you pay than Zambreros. | Quality ingredients and tastes great when done correctly, however itGÇÖs so inconsistent!  The portions in particularly, esp when you order online are all off! the same exact order always tastes different! My last wrap tasted just of the rice!  Worth noting: The staff are always nice! | Even when it's busy (and it can be quite busy), the staff always take the time to fill the burrito to a high standard. Also, they are always friendly and at times I can see they're under pressure but they are very patient and friendly with kids. My 5 year old loves it, and he only wants burritos from Zambrero so I put that down to the friendly atmosphere the staff create. Also, I never had an issue with the food, they're generous with the fillings and we do leave full and satisfied and as my son says...."it's Delicious". | Two Sausage behind the till shouting at me and my pregnant missus that they're closing at 8:55 when they close at 9:30. If he spoke to me like that and she wasn't present there would have been a different reaction. If you don't like your job quit ye weird individuals. Pathetic. | A great burrito all round. The staff are very nice and efficient. 10/10 would burrito again.
The Mex is a Mexican restaurant in Cork. Customer reviews say: EXCELLENT MEXICAN FOOD!!! We are from Arizona and this Mexican food ranked up with what we used to get. Easy access in the main square and decent levels of parking nearby. Staff was helpful and gave good advice on food. Decent seating. Good location near the titanic experience. Burrito was excellent. | The birria tacos are absolutely sensational!! The fact that you can mix and match your meats is even better! Lunch time crunch wrap is great value and well worth Gé¼5 | The birria tacos were wonderful! It made me feel back home. Cobh is far for me but I would definitely go back to try this food again. =ƒ½¦  The only think I would say is that (at least for me), you can add chopped onion and coriander to the birria tacos, that would give a more authentic flavour. Besides that is a 10/10 | Pretty authentic Mexican food, of which the Birria tacos are the absolute star. They are tender and greasy in all the good ways, and the dipping sauce is phenomenal. They also offer some sparkling juice drinks that are refreshing. Portions are decent. All dishes come takeaway. There's upstairs seating but feels like a quiet cafeteria or library. | Went here a few months ago and I got a very nice burrito. Good price and portion size. I would definitely recommend this place!
The Pavilion Garden Centre & Restaurant is a Mexican restaurant in Cork. Customer reviews say: We visited here a few times already and the food does not disappoint. We had the eggs benedict and it was perfectly cooked! Sourdough toast was of high quality and the coffee is really lovely. The place is ideal if you're looking to shop for your garden after a lovely meal =ƒÿè | I visit the Pavilion on a regular basis and absolute love the experience every time I call. I am always met with a warm welcome from all members of the staff. Today, I enquired about the availability of a flower in the garden centre. Joseph went above and beyond to share his knowledge and expertise. I also received very honest advice. He shared his time with us very willingly and was so helpful. After our enjoyable experience shopping, we were fit for a cup of tea and savoured the homemade soup and daily special. The food does not ever disappoint. It is always a challenge to keep a business fresh but I love how this family and staff change up displays regularly, update their products for sale and keep the items on sale current. I would recommend a trip to anyone. | Everything is delicious there is no argument, however rhe price is a bit outrageous. Gé¼15 for an eggs Benedict that comes with ONE piece of toast. I remember years ago they used to have two pieces of toast and a shaved ham which was much nicer. The actually flavour is great. The breakfast bowl is probably the best value because you get a lot to eat and it is delicious. I always love the iced coffees and we make sure to pick up some bread every time we visit. Great plave and lovely staff, just rather expensive so be aware. | Excellent place for wandering around the many beautiful plants, shrubs and the pots to put them in. After that, time to walk around the shop and then have a lovely bite to eat with drinks. Loads of staff and all very helpful and polite, very pleasing experience all round. Super spot. | I met two friends for coffee here this morning. On my way in to the cafe I saw a great display of cakes, among them cinnamon rolls, which I love. I ordered it once I sat down. When the waitress brought the cinnamon roll to the table, it had been heated, which I hadnGÇÖt asked for! As it was obviously heated in the microwave, the texture was terrible. It also tasted more of butter than cinnamon. Very disappointing =ƒÖü! It was really cold in the cafe too. After sitting there for just over 1 hour, my feet were like ice blocks when I got back to my car! I wouldnGÇÖt be running back here!!
The Idle Hour is a Mexican restaurant in Cork. Customer reviews say: During my stroll through the charming Port of Cork, I stumbled upon a quaint Irish pub that beckoned me inside. Eager to experience a taste of the local culture, I decided to stop in for a refreshing drink. From the moment I entered, the barmaid (server) greeted me with genuine warmth, kindness, and a helpful attitude.  Taking note of my curiosity, she attentively listened to my preferences and offered a wonderful suggestion: Irish apple cider. It happened to be my first time trying cider, and I'm delighted to say it was a delightful choice. The cider was perfectly crafted, striking a harmonious balance between sweetness and crispness that left me longing for another sip.  The pub itself exuded a friendly and inviting atmosphere. Although the bustling bar area was occupied, the cozy coaches offered a serene spot for me to unwind and savor my drink. Immersed in the authentic Irish ambiance, I couldn't help but appreciate the genuine sense of camaraderie and enjoyment that permeated the air.  This impromptu visit to the Irish pub left a lasting impression on me. The attentive and amiable service provided by the barmaid, along with the exceptional Irish apple cider, contributed to a truly memorable experience. I relished every moment, immersing myself in the rich tapestry of Irish tradition and hospitality.  If you find yourself exploring the Port of Cork, I wholeheartedly recommend paying a visit to this charming pub. Whether you're a cider aficionado or simply seeking a genuine taste of Ireland, you'll be treated to a warm welcome, an inviting atmosphere, and a drink that will transport you to good places. | Decent locals bar in the docks area know as 'Jewtown'. Friendly and first bar you encounter if you come along Kennedy Quay from the Marina Market. You can see how all the new office blocks are built around this holdout. | Great find walking back towards town after eating at marina markets.  Felt very much like a locals place but was still very welcoming. The barman was friendly and even provided free pizza for everyone in the bar! What a gentleman! | Idle Hour very kindly hosted the afterparty for the Frontrunners & Briskwalkers Cork Pride 5K 2025 in conjunction with Cork Pride. With almost 100 people attending the event the service and atmosphere provided was top notch and we are very grateful for the same. | Great pub for a smashing pint of stout and reasonable on the edge of cork city.
Cafe Gusto Lapps Quay is a Mexican restaurant in Cork. Customer reviews say: It is hard to find a perfect iced coffee in Cork but Cafe Gusto make a perfect iced coffee (Mocha)! | It was a drizzly rainy day, therefore no outside seating. It's a tiny little place but there is seating for probably 6 or 8 people. We had. Our breakfast sandwich was scrambled eggs on toast and some cappuccino and tea. Very nice and cozy. The staff was very friendly and took good care of us. | Great little spot to stop and have a snack and tea or coffee. Friendly staff great service and fabulous views. Our group enjoyed it immensely. Recommend this little cafe. Thanks guys. | Its a great place and wonderful coffee | Nice being able to sit by the water. Coffee is fine.
Zambrero Little Island is a Mexican restaurant in Cork. Customer reviews say: Absolutely top class.....food delicious and delivered with such courtesy, cheer and kindness by Sinead.  As I told her....she runs the place like she owns it....in recent years I can honestly say I've never experienced such amazing customer service ......especially when u consider it was at the end of her shift 7.55pm....My money is on u Sinead....you'll go far in this life.....guaranteed.  many thanks again | Saoirse was absolutely amazing, the service she provided was 10/10. The place looked super clean and tidy which was amazing to see. The burrito I got was very fresh tasting and lovely and warm. Overall this was the best experience I have had in the whole of the shop so far. Very friendly and professional staff and very accommodating. Saoirse made it very easy to order as she explained what everything was, what she herself would usually get and provided some amazing options. Will 100% be returning again!!! | First time I have been asked to leave a review by a staff member, and you know what, I love the confidence. Food is incredible, with this place being so popular, you are always getting the freshest possible ingredients as they sell so fast and they need to keep topping up. Everything from the rice to the lime juice, prepared in store. Staff are extremely friendly and well trained, sometimes I even wonder if they are trained in conversation with customers as I always seem to walk away from the till with a smile on my face. I have also noticed that they change gloves between each customer, which proves the level of cleanliness and quality within the kitchen. I have experienced the burritos from each staff member and I have to say, the consistency is unbelievable. Either the manager has hit the jackpot with staff or learned how to correctly manage people ( a very rare skill these days ). Great job guys I have been blown away, see you tomorrow! | Our office order from this zambrero all the time and love it so much it's concerning. Staff are always lovely and happy to help. Shout out to Saoirse for adding guacamole to our burrito G¥ñn+Å=ƒÿü | Frequently come here to zambrero in little island , and i was disgusted by the attitude of one employee in paticular whom stood and refused to ask any questions regarding my order and decided to do her own twist on my food . when i had asked for pinto beans which is usually asked for before the rice she had rolled her eyes and put a pea sized amount on , paid for a GÇ£big burrito GÇ£ ended up getting charged for a GÇ£big one GÇ£ but got a small one .
Hungry Hippo Cork is a Mexican restaurant in Cork. Customer reviews say: Hungry Hippo has a lovely ambience, great staff, and a fantastic location in the city center. The ranch burger was really good and the cauliflower burger was full of flavor. However, the cauliflower wings were a big letdown GÇö far too salty. I ordered 10 wings for Gé¼12 but could barely eat two and had to send the rest back after informing the waiter. | Shared a MASSIVE platter of 5 items and was wayyyy to big for 2 people (which we didn't mind - took some back to hotel). Everything was extremely tasty and cooked well. The wings were perfectly flavored. Service was consistent. Atmosphere was good. Best restaurant we visited in Cork :) | Had a great lunch here last Sunday! We took advantage of the Sunday buy one get one free deal on vegan mains. I got the Beyond Classic which was really delicious. I'd happily order again, really good flavours and portion size. My husband got the Crunchy Chick with 3 extra chicken wings, which he really liked. And we got a portion of vegan buffalo wings to share. They were not bad but I wasn't super keen on the flavour of the sauce and the breadcrumbs had gone soggy from being cooked in the sauce - not my personal preference! We're already planning another visit to try some of the Christmas specials! | It was our first time in this restaurant, and for the first time we left with a not really good impression. The staff seem very nice, but somehow you need to order your food and drink at the bar. It wasnGÇÖt a big issue until I saw the salad of my friend where they have used not fresh salad leaves, it looked truly disgusting. One of my friends is vegan so she had ordered a vegan option, but when she asked the staff member in which oil it was cooked- the staff member truly struggled to respond. I didnGÇÖt see a proper service in this place, feels like you have been left out. Nobody even said GÇ£goodbyeGÇ¥ to us at the end. | The burger and fries were well cooked and tasted great, I also had the oreo milkshake, however itGÇÖs more of a vanilla milkshake with a few oreos sprinkled on top. They could do with either bringing in table service, or using QR codes at the table to order, maybe more clear on the menu on additions you can add like bacon to burgers etc. that might be on it iGÇÖm not sure but i didnGÇÖt see it. Overall still a good feed.
Lucha Libre is a Mexican restaurant in Cork. Customer reviews say: I had heard and seen about this place online, and finally decided to try it out yesterday, all I can say is IGÇÖm sorry I waited so long to eat here.  Without the best most authentic Mexican food Iv had in cork.  I got the corn tortillas, my partner got the chicken nachos and our son got tacos.  The food was incredible and so tasty, we didnGÇÖt have to wait long at all and the service was excellent, price was very fair, will 100% be back, and would highly recommend if you like Mexican food or looking to try something different. | I've had absolutely everything on his menu (so far) and it has never disappointed. His homemade taco sauce is the winner and would make a piece of cardboard taste amazing. This place is a must try for anyone that loves food with flavour. | Honestly the best place in cork area for food. Not a bad item on the menu and the specials are always amazing and changed frequently. Very reasonably priced and service is great | I've eaten there few times, and every dish has been delicious so far. The wait wasn't long, the service was efficient, and everything was fresh. Today I had the steak sandwich for the first timeGÇöit was fantastic. I highly recommend it. | Amazing. Food is fresh and very flavourful. Service is excellent. Very obliging and friendly. Everything we have ordered has been delicious. Best place for food in ballincollig hands down!
Supermac's & Papa John's Cork City is a Mexican restaurant in Cork. Customer reviews say: Staff are super nice and welcoming. They even helped me me out when I wanted ketchup even though itGÇÖs self service. The pizza is good as always. | Does double pepperoni mean only two slices of pepperoni on every pizza slice!? It is an extra cost to get noteven a regular amount of pepperoni It's a pizza so it doesn't need to be artsy or fancy just look at a photo of what we got VS what they are selling | was in there 21/10/25, the best burger in Cork, v. clean place, nice staff | i bought garlic bread from here and to be fair they gave us a lot but my god was it a waste. it tastes like i was eating RAW garlic with a bit of bread it was the most vile garlic bread i've EVER eaten do NOT waste your money on this i can't even call it food this is a disgrace it's atrocious preposterous even my goodness if i could take back time id never buy this greasy disgrace i wouldn't wish this on my worst enemy a homeless man on the side of the road could do better my goodness. i am appalled. they're pizza tho that's a diffrent story. it was pretty good my friend likes it more but eh | I bought a chicken burger thing, and a chunk of lettuce was wrapped in someoneGÇÖs long dark hair. I have short hair myself so that could not have belonged to me. Absolutely repulsive. Get your workers to wear hair nets. Especially the ones with longer hair.
Blarney Burger is a Mexican restaurant in Cork. Customer reviews say: Owner greeted us and was incredibly friendly. The food was ABSOLUTELY delicious! Our family had hamburgers and chicken sandwiches and they were cooked to perfection. It was only a short walk from the Blarney Castle car park and a great price and serving size. Highly recommend! | The burger here was just DELICIOUS. Top notch quality ingredients. Fresh and not greasy meat, perfect cooking and the homemade sauces are super tasty. Cauliflowers and chicken tenders were perfect as well. The cherry on top was the Biscoff Tiramisu to finish the dinner. 100% sure, I'll be back and more than once =ƒÿà. Staffs and owners are also super friendly. | Stopped by on the bike as they opened, one of the best smash style burgers. The double cheeseburger was delicious and the skin-on  fries were seasoned and fried to perfection.  I will remember to order a smaller burger to leave room for a desert on my next visit. | When we walked in we were greeted by the lovely owner and got seated at a table right away. We had ordered our food and it came within 10 minutes. The food was DELICIOUS. We ordered 6 burgers, were able to customise them and they came with delicious crunchy fries and sauces. The burgers were amazing infused with a delicious creamy burger sauce and tender chicken. | Delicious!! Shared the Raclette burger and the Hot Honey Glazed chicken and both were superb. The garlic parmesan fries were absolutely perfect. And the pistachio milkshake =ƒÿï. Server Yana was also super friendly and went out of her way to make us feel welcomed and well taken care of. My only complaint - it was a bit chilly inside. Wear an extra layer!
Arthur Mayne's Pharmacy is a Mexican restaurant in Cork. Customer reviews say: Quirky bar with lovely selection of tasty dishes, which could be snacks or full meals. We visited twice and had pork belly with black pudding, a version of patatas bravas and  a meat/cheese board. Drinks took a while to come at one point, but otherwise service was great - including alerting us to a better table becoming available. | Really fun, laid-back atmosphere. It's theme is an old pharmacy: tinctures and perfumes in glass cases. I had the Irish Coffee. It was really good. | Had a fantastic espresso martini and steamed mussels in a beautiful vintage setting. Staff was very friendly and helpful. Great place for an un-intimidating yet special night of drinks and small bites | This place was so funky and different! The food was so tasty and absolutely packing a punch with flavour. Such a gem!!! | The atmosphere is relaxed and welcoming, the drinks are good quality, and itGÇÖs a perfect place to unwind with friends. A unique pub with character GÇö definitely worth a visit. =ƒì+
Clayton Hotel Cork City is a Mexican restaurant in Cork. Customer reviews say: I had a wonderful stay at Clayton Hotel Cork City. The location is perfect GÇö everything in Cork is within walking distance, and the hotel has excellent facilities including a pool, sauna, and fitness centre. The breakfast was delicious with plenty of variety.  The room was clean, spacious, and comfortable, with lovely views and everything I needed. Most importantly, the staff were exceptionally friendly and attentive. I contacted the hotel in advance with a small request, and they kindly offered me a room even better than the one I booked. This really showed how much they care about their guests.  Overall, I highly recommend Clayton Hotel Cork City for its great service, comfort, and fantastic location. I will definitely return on my next visit to Cork. | My son and I stayed here for his birthday , he picked it out as the location suited and it has a pool . I had stayed here in the past and had a nicer experience. The online check in is handy but it found it confusing because thereGÇÖs no information given about breakfast/ pool use etc . So I think that needs to be looked at . Receptionist was very lovely do and when we collected our bags she wished my son a happy birthday and dropped up a sweet treat which was the highlight of our stay ! The pools fab and clean and staff there are so lovely too . Breakfast was surprisingly delicious ( we were affraid after reading reviews ) but we couldnGÇÖt fault it and staff were nice too ! The worst part was the room it was to y and internal , the window looked down to the lobby it felt so claustrophobic and with no fan in the bathroom and aircon it was so stuffy ! The rooms very basic and needs some extra touchGÇÖs and a deep clean ! I understand the hotel needs to use all rooms but I believe more transparency is needed for these rooms , the last time we stayed we had a fabulous sea view and it was the deluxe double room we booked then too . Perhaps offer a discounted room rate for these internal rooms so people can decide when their booking as I feel I paid quite a high rate for this shoebox which IGÇÖm sad to say has turned me off booking the hotel again ! Also the area has gotten very bad around the hotel I know this is out of your control just feel I should mention it I wouldnGÇÖt be comfortable to stay with my kids there again either ! | Great location and walkable to City Centre. Bus station close. We had a king room with a view of the river and it was very nice. Highly recommend.  Staff at front desk were helpful and attentive at breakfast.  The bar staff were inattentive. You had to ask to order and get your bill. They did not check back on you.  I would recommend this location. | My wife and I booked one night.  We were very pleased with the room and general amenity area of the hotel. All the public areas were very clean and impressive.  The room was very nice, spacious and well laid out with everything you could look for in a room.  We had dinner in the bar on the evening of our arrival.  It was really excellent and good value and waiting staff were very attentive and pleasant.  The breakfast in the morning was very good with plenty of everything.  The one quibble I would have was that the cooked items were not very hot and had gone quiet cool by the time we had finished.  Apart from that everything was lovely and if we have to overnight in Cork again we will definitely be booking the hotel. | Absolutely fabulous stay from start to finish. From checking in with Emma on the front desk. Room was gorgeous really comfy beds. We had dinner and it was a 10 out of 10 got the steak and my God was worth every penny was absolutely Devine and cooked to perfection.breakfast was also a 10 out of 10 everything was fresh and selection was fab. Will most definitely stay here again
The Old Town Taqueria @ Black Dog is a Mexican restaurant in Cork. Customer reviews say: Boom. Amazing tacos, totally legit. Great service too, staff were great and a mean Margarita. Fun seeing the guys make the tacos in the bar. A dive bar though so not for all but those tacos will have me back again for sure | Got the Birria  tacos and churros.  The tacos were flavourful, the beef was succulent and the tacos  were grilled to perfection.  I didnGÇÖt like the churros that much unfortunately I felt it was too oily for my liking. I would like to try the pork carnitas next. | The best food I've had in a while. Best cocktail I've ever had. Best music while we were eating. Absolutely criminal why there wasn't a queue out the door. That said we tried to book a table and it said none available, turned up on the off chance and the place was empty. Best food/drink /music ever! So happy =ƒññ=ƒññ=ƒññ (I would fight people for the beef tacos!) | This would have got 5 from me but the recent price increases and the strange photos which are definitely not accurate from the business here bring it down to 3.  The menu for 2 Tacos and 1 drink say Gé¼16, but we were charged Gé¼17.  Most other prices have increased too, so we won't go here as much as we previously did.  Food is nice here. But there aren't many seats inside. I don't know why they have photos of comfy couchesunless you can order these in the bar next door? | Second time here and it's just such a fun place to go! My friend's absolute go-to for when she has visitors and I completely get why! In the summer they open the front window and you get a nice breeze. The food is delicious and the atmosphere is great.
GLOBE Restaurant and Bar is a Mexican restaurant in Cork. Customer reviews say: Though the service was friendly, it was sparse and you had to wait a long time to get a drink or your order taken. Pints were overpriced. It is a posh comfortable environment, but it felt like everyone there was on business or holiday. There was nothing really wrong with it, this just isnGÇÖt my favorite type of Irish spot. CanGÇÖt say I was very impressed. If youGÇÖre staying in the hotel and just want something easy and convenient, go for it. If wanting to explore Cork, there are many other good spots for a pint and/or a good bite. | The service in this restaurant tonight was appalling. At entrance, no one was there to seat us so we had to find our own seats. We waited around 15 minutes to even receive menus, even that we had to call a second waitress over to get them as the first one we called over never ended up giving them to us even though she said she would. The food was acceptable, but the service did not create a pleasant or enjoyable atmosphere. We later received our food and waited an extra 10 minutes whilst eating to receive our drinks. I also received the worst pint of coors I have ever seen in my entire life, the head on the pint was paper thin and the pint overall tasted funny. The bartender agreed with me that the pint did not look right but didnGÇÖt offer me a new one just topped up the head on the same pint instead. When we finished our meal, I stood up as no one was coming to us to offer us a dessert menu and walked to the entrance where there was a waitress. I asked her for the dessert menu and she then begged me to sit down and said she would bring one to me. At the end of the night the waitress handed me the bill and asked me to please check the bill? I have never been asked this before, as expected the bill was wrong and I was being charged for items I did not order. She then reprinted the bill and asked me to check it once again. When I confronted one of the staff for the unacceptable waiting time she told me to GÇ£maybe book tomorrow insteadGÇ¥. This was not a great experience and I am very disappointed in the restaurant and its staff as the restaurant was not busy at all and I would not be recommending this restaurant to anyone I know. | The staff is really friendly and try to do their best, however food is absolutely horrendous. Worst curry IGÇÖve ever had. | I was staying at the hotel for work and came to the restaurant hoping for a quick dinner before a busy evening. Unfortunately, the experience left a lot to be desired. There was no one to greet me when I arrived, and I stood waiting for about five minutes before another guest kindly informed me I should just seat myself. I wasnGÇÖt given a menu and had to go to the bar to ask for one.  Service was very slow GÇö it took a while for anyone to take my drink and food order. I ordered the pork belly and waited around 45 minutes before checking in, only to be told there had been delays due to a fire drill earlier that affected the gas supply. This hadnGÇÖt been mentioned when I ordered.  When the food arrived (after about an hour), it was just okay. The pork belly was unfortunately overcooked and quite dry. I had originally planned to stay for dessert, but decided it wasnGÇÖt worth the extra time.  If youGÇÖre staying here and hoping for a smooth, timely meal, IGÇÖd recommend looking elsewhere. | Tried to eat there last night and it was PACKED!  Had my dinner there tonight soGÇªupon entering I was accommodated at a table that was reserved; yes I was informed it was reserve for 2 hrs later. Fair as I was alone so it wasnGÇÖt an issue. The staff were exceptional! So kind and considerate. My meal came  SO fast & thank goodness for that because I was starving.  My salad was fresh and tasty! Nice chunks of avocado too.  My chicken supreme was SO SO GOOD! I normally donGÇÖt eat cauliflower so I gave it a taste tonight and ended up eating it. That goes to show on how well prepare
Cafe Mexicana is a Mexican restaurant in Cork. Customer reviews say: Absolutely fantastic! Came here for my wifeGÇÖs birthday whilst having a weekend away in Cork and everything about Cafe Mexicana was spot on. Food, service, atmosphere all 10/10. The prices are very reasonable too. We would definitely return when back in Cork. | I couldnGÇÖt fault it, food was fantastic, service was excellent. Very cosy and fabulous atmosphere. | WOW What an experience, there was two of us out for a birthday meal, we got the share combo which was absolutely delicious!! Great value and good prices a must see if in Cork | Midweek lunch and I ordered vegetarian fajitas (vegan friendly). My gosh it was fantastic! I had to tell the chef personally.  My favourite was actually the soft corn tortillas; amazing flavour and incredibly fresh. Little tostados (like nachos) of different colours were great too. I asked for mine to be spicy and it was a little hot, not too crazy. Very morish.  My mate got the mole and it was tasty. Both meals presented really lovely.  Our serving staff was really friendly too.  My slight criticisms: my fork was a bit dirty still, and the restaurant was a little cold (other diners also noted this).  I hope to be back soon!! | Fantastic food. Tasty and delicious. We enjoyed every mouthful. Reasonable prices. Great service from the young lady who served us on Friday. Our second visit and it definitely won't be our last when we're in Cork.
KC & Son & Sons is a Mexican restaurant in Cork. Customer reviews say: KC & Son & Sons is a Cork staple! It is definitely worth the drive to Douglas to go stand in the queue down the street from their door way! Their pittas are really worth it!  Staff: The staff are very friendly here. They are also very attentive and get the order right everytime no matter how big your order is.  Food: They have so many choices to choose from here with their Pittas being the main items that they are known for! Some of their best pittas in my own opinion are the King Creole (Chicken), the Philly Steak (Beef) and my personal favourites the Angry Spaniard (Chicken & Chorizo) and the Kansas City Pitta (Pork). The Angry Spaniard is a hot Pitta filled Chips, Mayo, Lettuce and topped off with Chorizo, Chicken and hot sauce! Then the Kansas City Pitta is a hot Pitta filled with Chips, Mayo, Lettuce, sliced gherkin and topped off with slow roasted pork belly that is rubbed with their own blend of spices and coated in a homemade BBQ sauce! Whats not to love! They also serve really tasty burgers and they have the world of side options. These range from chips to Pineapple Fritters to their famous Chicken Bombays. They have these huge bags too if you order a lot of food or if you need to carry your option in one bag. Handy to bring it on a picnic.  Queue: Don't be phased by the queue here as sometimes it could be 10 people long and just inside the premises or 30 people deep outsode of the premises! It does move fast and you won't be waiting any longer than 30 minutes to get inside to make your order.  Layout: The new layout is much more efficient and it goes as follows: You walk up one side of the queuing area inside the premesis and at the top of this side you place your order, then turn at the top and you walk back down the other side towards the doorway and they will have your order prepaired and ready for collection juat as you go out the door!  Overall Recommendation: I highly recommend calling to KC & Son & Sons as its a Cork staple! I always find myself here every couple of weeks and I nearly always find myself going for something different to what I ordered last time! | Very famous family run restaurant which was prevented from closing due to the crowdGÇÖs demand is a must try outlet. You need loads of patience to get your food, huge queue and there is waiting period almost every time IGÇÖve visited here. Chicken Bombay is fantastic and the KC special chicken burger is a delight. | Very Disappointed GÇô Philly Steak Pita Quality Is Now Horrible  IGÇÖve been ordering from CaseyGÇÖs for around 10 years and always enjoyed the Philly Steak pita. I used to get it fairly often over the years, and it was always great.  I hadnGÇÖt ordered anything for about a year, but in the last two months I started visiting CaseyGÇÖs again. I ordered the Philly Steak pita three times GÇö and each time, the quality of the beef was really bad. YesterdayGÇÖs order was the worst.  The beef was cheap, full of fatty bits, no taste, tough to chew GÇö just horrible. ItGÇÖs definitely not the same as it used to be. I donGÇÖt know what happened, but the quality has gone way down, and IGÇÖm really disappointed. My son did get a pita recently, I think with curry sauce, and he really enjoyed it GÇö so not everything is bad. But the Philly Steak pita definitely needs attention. I hope the quality improves, because it used to be one of the best. | I've waited months to try KC's food and was really excited for it I finally tried it tonight and I was really disappointed i would nearly go as far as saying it was horrible the angry Spaniard Pitta it was really dry tasteless and the chicken was dry and rubbery. The chips Cheese and curry were tasteless I don't know what the hype was about it's definitely not worth it and I will definitely not be returning again. | Crazy tasty but out of fish =ƒÿö really stoked for the fish and chips at the high recommendation of locals but they told us th
The Flying Burrito Food company is a Mexican restaurant in Cork. Customer reviews say: Leng food , burritos have already been alright but these make me feel something | Omds so good I made a episode there =ƒñ¬ | Peng food sammy loves the food cuz hes a fat bai | Best food ever Jamie twomey even made a hub vid there so smexy | Often enough I stop by for my breakfast bap in the flying burrito one off the finest baps in the market it would be my first port to call when in the mood for a breakfast such a customer friendly service with the highest quality would recommend for those passing to give it I try you won't regret =ƒÖî=ƒÖî=ƒÖî
Koto is a Mexican restaurant in Cork. Customer reviews say: Amazing restaurant! The food is absolutely delicious, with great attention to detail. The staff are friendly, attentive, and welcoming. The place itself is modern, stylish, and very comfortable. They also have a fully vegan menu GÇö just ask the staff for it. I had the tofu Pad Thai, and it was incredible! A must-visit spot in Cork GÇô highly recommended! | Tried Koto, an Asian fusion spot, and really enjoyed it! I got the popcorn tofu for the appetizer and the kabocha for the main- both were delicious, but the kabocha especially stood out. ItGÇÖs the kind of dish that feels comforting and satisfying without being too heavy. =ƒì£  Definitely planning to come back againGÇöthere are so many more options on the menu, and if these dishes are anything to go by, IGÇÖm sure it wonGÇÖt disappoint.  Ratings: =ƒì¦ Food & Flavor: 4.5/5 =ƒ¢Ä Service & Ambience: 4.5/5 =ƒÆ+ Value for Money: 4/5 | Food at KOTO is excellent GÇô fresh, high quality and full of flavor. The Pad Thai Tofu and baby potatoes were amazing, and the hazelnut brownie with ice cream was fab. They have a separate gluten-free and vegan menu, which is a big plus. Service was great GÇô when my partnerGÇÖs curry was too salty, they immediately replaced it with a perfect one. Lovely ambience, great cocktails, and you definitely need to book in advance! | Have you ever been so cold and hungry that you literally feel like your first spoonful of soup is regenerating your will to live? That was me having a bowl of the farang noodle soup at Koto. Flavors were exceptional, chicken was tender and I swear to sweet baby Jesus it warmed me down to my very soul. Gyosa was good too. | We went to Kato for lunch, very decent place, fast service, good food. Noodles were extremly flavourful thanks to good use of spices which made food very delicious. My friend chose different dish but we both had duck and we both agreed that duck was cheewy and bit dry. Other than that everything was great.
Burritos & Blues is a Mexican restaurant in Cork. Customer reviews say: If you are looking for an affordable Mexican experience, this is the place to go. They use fresh ingredients and prepare your food when you order it. Best value for money. Excellent customer service as well. You can customize your order and as usual I have provided their menu on the pictures. You can dine in and do take away whatever suits you but I recommend eating there as food is prepared fresh. I always order their burritos, nachos, and quesadillas. I always eat here when IGÇÖm craving for nachos. It is definitely worth the visit :) | Only place in town that still gives massive meat portions in 2025!!! They are literally the only place that is not stingy on the meat. I used to go to places like boojum and zambreros but burritos and blues has become my go to now that their prices are not outrageous! You can even do half and half and mix meat types! Its really so much better than anywhere else for the price. They know what they are doing, and I am now a loyal customer! Really good for students too. | Really good food served here, different types of burritos (wrapped, bowls, etc), and different meat types (including vegetarian). The staff are lovely to deal with, and are helpful when you ask questions with the food, making good suggestions. Servings are plenty big, and everything can be customized to just how you want it. The seating is okay upstairs, maybe not too suitable for thise with limited mobility, as the seats are more like benches, so you have to be able to lift your legs up and over to sit. Additionally  the stairs are quite steep going up and down, and the stairs to the 2nd floor with the bathrooms has a loose handrail, and the floor boards are split and the steps quite uneven, so big caution is needed! Moreover (at least for the men's bathroom), they are in a not too good condition. They are clean, every time I have been there, but the hand dryer is broken, the soap is often empty, and singular stall door cannot close and has to be left open, and the light in the stall does not work, so you NEED the door open haha. Overall amazing value for the food, but the seating choices and restroom conditions should be addressed. | Absolutely Gorgeous Food  =ƒÿï Wow !!! Just Wow =ƒññ         yummy, yummy =ƒÆ» Affordable prices too =ƒæî=ƒÅ+  Absolutely recommend =ƒÖâ Ty for reading =ƒ½¦=ƒÅ+ | One of my go to, love of the loaded fries. Wish there burrito bowls were a bit bigger even if didn't fill them all the way as often bits falls out when try to mix it. They have definitely gotten lazy in chopping the pico de gallo, the tomato pieces are hugh chunks which isn't nice.
Zambrero is a Mexican restaurant in Cork. Customer reviews say: Wanted a small lunch to tide me over until dinner time. Decided to get the small portion of nachos (Gé¼6.50) which consisted of a cardboard container about the size of a tiny egg carton, less than ten bland tortilla chips, a literal tablespoon of beef, a tiny sprinkle of cheese and the rest covered in lettuce. A tablespoon of guacamole cost an extra Gé¼1.40 so it cost Gé¼7.90 in total for the tiniest portion that wouldnGÇÖt even be sufficient for a small child. DidnGÇÖt even taste good to make up for the extortionate cost and tiny portion size. Food was not put on a tray or anything for dining in. Was still hungry after it. Absolute joke. Definitely would not go back.  Edit: Hey Jessica, well done on completely refusing to acknowledge my complaint as a whole and refusing any accountability for the experience. The Nachos were listed in the following sizes "Small, Medium and Large". There is no "mini" option. In regards to your nachos being sourced from Tipperary, do you mean the chips? If so, I'm afraid I can't comment on how good they were since there was so few of them, but well done on taking credit for someone else's product.  I won't be visiting again as one visit was plenty. Thanks once again for your reply, it only serves to further encourage me to stay far away from the store you manage. | Please teach your rude staff how to talk to customers (specially with ladies). We order from this outlet very regularly because they serve delicious food but my wife had an unpleasant experience with the staff member today while placing the order. The Burrito and Taco were very tasty though. But we will give it a second thought before going here again next time. We don't want to have a bad experience before having food. | Food is always great. Staff super pleasant even though it was pretty busy when we visited. Kudos. | I used to love this zambrero but new staff literally ruined my toasted burrito twice in a row unable to wrap it and also toast is wrongly that the wrap glues to the aluminum and off course a mess barely any heat on the toaster and also wrapped was all ripped while closing worker noticed it and still continued, I just felt bad as there was a queue and didn't want to cause issues of other but won't be eating at this zambrero not until I see they are back as they were before. Train the staff this is what makes shop shut down | Food was amazing, got served by staff member tadgh and burrito was amazing. I'll be back when he's working :)
The Old Town Taqueria Caf+¬ is a Mexican restaurant in Cork. Customer reviews say: Delicious tacos! Discovered this place on Instagram through @CravingCork reels, and I had to try it, and it did not disappoint. The tacos we got were so good we reordered them a second time!  We got the churros for dessert and they were good, the only negative thing was just the chocolate sauce that came with them wasn't good. It was very liquidity. But other than that, everything else was good. Staff very friendly and accommodating. | The Birria Beef tacos are lovely here.  I love places like this with a really short menu. Easy to choose what you want, and you know it's going to be very good.  Good size portion too for the price.  We will be back aswe want to try the churros here. | IGÇÖm going to be the realest of the real, here. If youGÇÖve had birria before, this is not birria. So set your expectations. Yes, it has the consum+¬, and that was spot on. But the tacos are absolutely stuffed to the brim with black beans. So thatGÇÖs all you taste, and is not part of a traditional birria. Went with a party of 2 Americans, 1 Irish American, and 1 Irish - none of us would go back. The food was *fine*. A bit charred. It just wasnGÇÖt wow-worthy and wasnGÇÖt what we expected. ItGÇÖs also pricey.  Since it was nearly impossible to tell if there was seating from the listing, I tried to show some of it in my photo here. The service was meh - kind of typical Irish where youGÇÖre inconveniencing them by having to do their jobs. No smile or hello or thank you, just glowering.  After all that winging IGÇÖll give my pros, to be fair:  - coldest Coke IGÇÖve had in my life, it was heaven on earth - consum+¬ was good - stuffed to the brim, very meat-heavy tacos they werenGÇÖt skimping | I got the chicken taco. It was very soggy and wet. It tasted ok. My friend got the beef taco which was a bit better. I expected a little more. | Nice, quick spot for food! The birria tacos were delicious, I wish I had ordered two of those cause they were that good. Both tacos had plenty of  filling, making them worth the price, the food is cooked in front of you and came out fast
The Black Market is a Mexican restaurant in Cork. Customer reviews say: The Black Market is a super trendy spot with a great mix of food vendors GÇö everything from pizza and burgers to coffee and sweet treats. ThereGÇÖs both indoor and outdoor seating, giving it a relaxed, social vibe.  We treated ourselves to a delicious pizza from Burnt Pizza, followed by a juicy burger and crispy chips from Smash Burger. For drinks, we had a creamy white chocolate mocha from Soma Coffee, and wrapped it all up with a beautifully smooth vanilla milkshake.  Parking was fine since it wasnGÇÖt too busy when we went. Overall, we really enjoyed our visit and will definitely be back! | ! BEWARE OF CLAMPERS !  Next door there is a overflow car park but if you are not exactly parked in the signed space the clampers will charge you Gé¼125 for your lunch. Operated by Munster Parking Services. Catches people most weekends trying to get out and support local stalls. Loads parked in a very quiet area with no businesses open so no harm to anyone.  Other than that, the place is very nice and I'm happy it exists. Toilets could be a bit better and everything is over priced. But that's more of an Ireland problem than anything else. | Much more cozy and cool than the Marina market. Parking can be a bit of a headache at busier times even with the overflow lot due to no parking on the street. Had a delicious sandwich from tongue tied | Lovely quiet place compared to the Marina Market.  The big horror themed art pictures on display is a let down though. No need for it. If you're thinking of bringing children in here I'd strongly advise against it.  Also, not too many good options here. The restaurants that are there, from my experiences here, don't offer good quality food. It's mediocre standards. The best place here is Soma. Good coffee & nice snacks (although the snacks are quite pricey).  The Marina Market is better for food quality & more food options, but The Black Market is better to go & chill with nice coffee.  Also, The Black Market isn't open 7 days a week like The Marina Market, which is a little disappointing because I have come here a few times when it was closed. | Mixed experience I'd say. The Asian food spot was ok, nice fried rice dish but the 'tempura' prawns were just deep fried. The chicken place is a total mess, tasted like they bathed the chicken in rice wine vinegar. The decor of the place is hilarious, looks like if you allowed a 13 year old boy to decorate his own bedroom haha
Woolshed Baa & Grill - Cork is a Mexican restaurant in Cork. Customer reviews say: Good spot with comfortable atmosphere to visit during the day, and a great spot to catch an early football match. We lucked out by checking their Instagram story and managed to get a code for a free wings and pint of Heineken each worth about Gé¼20 each - Worth checking out if you plan to stop in here just in case! Wings were lovely and the pint was a pint. =ƒæì It should be noted that this whole venue is 21+ ALL DAY on Saturday (also Friday I believe) but they make exceptions to families. We saw two 18 year old lads with IDs get turned away at around 2pm, while there were actual toddlers wandering around inside. Odd rule so plan ahead! Nice if you're older as it's a less messy atmosphere than some of the 18+ bars in the city on the weekend. | My favorite spot in Cork. The atmosphere of this place is unmatched, and they have the best staff around. I always come here for my football matches, they always try to put them on for me even though they're international matches. Food is amazing- especially the dadinhos!! They also have corona on tap which I've yet to find at any other Cork bar. Have a great pub quiz and music bingo hosted here too. It's really the place to be. | Visited the Wool Shed Bar and Grill and they have a nice menu I went with the Chips and Pulled Pork simply because it was the only meal on the menu that came with chips.  It is definitely very popular for the price of Gé¼9.90 as I seen staff going back and forth to different tables with this meal. I would of going with the Chicken for Gé¼18 euros but for such a pricey chicken it do not come with a few chips. If chips was added to that menu item and other menu items they would definitely sell a lot more from the menu.  The pulled pork and chips were very tasty and filling definitely worth the price. Cooked well. The service from the staff was excellent checking to see if all was ok. The girl that took the order was very nice and very helpful with explaining the menu.  The Mardyke Entertainment Venue is very large as it has a large snooker and pool section. It has bowling lanes and there is an open air rooftop area. Downstairs more seating for large groups for food and dinning.  Also another small bar with arcade games called the Barcadia. The main downstairs pub has-á plenty of screens with lots of choices to watch different sports. This entertainment venue has it all.  Great staff great service and great food.  Would just add that if the meals came with chips as standard the meals would definitely be value for money and add more variety and would sell more. | So incredibly disappointing place! Hotel recommendations as we were in town and wanted to watch a NFL game. Walked a mile+ and then ho thereGÇª.lots of people. Several games on. Unfortunately after spending time to signing-up on your phone, verifying your email, searching the beers list and ordering. It was 2 minutes too late to order food. For goodness sake, itGÇÖs 9pm 2+ hours until close. You have 50+ people here. Guess I canGÇÖt drink but a beer or two on an empty stomach. =ƒÿí | Excellent service. Watch any sport you like. They will find it. Management really look after you. Great atmosphere, cold beers, great food. Definitely one if my favorite pubs in Cork.
La Calavera Burrito Bar is a Mexican restaurant in Cork. Customer reviews say: Great quesadillas with pulled beef, medium green sauce is delicious. A good value feast. Should keep me going for a few hours. | I have been going to La Calavera for a number of years and have always found the food fantastic! The staff are very attentive and the service is quick. The premises is nicely decorated and always clean. I always get the Chicken Fajita with Salsa Verde, it is amazing! They also do great tacos and a number of other dishes! | Food wasnGÇÖt great at all, burrito fillings were very dry and lacking any real flavour, had to force myself to finish it. Prices were decent and staff were friendly but unfortunately canGÇÖt see myself going back ever again, will stick to the other burrito places in Cork. | Meat is slightly underseasoned and slightly too dry. Portions are decent. The overall meal is very dry because there is a lack of sauce, even though I had sour cream and salsa in it. There is not many flavours really as the balance between components is lacking. Ingredients however seem to be off decent quality. | Very tasty taco fries and Carnitas burrito. Super reasonable pricing and lovely man working inside =ƒÿè
Boojum is a Mexican restaurant in Cork. Customer reviews say: perfect for when youGÇÖre hungry and need something filling and healthy. one can get student discounts as well. | Absolutely love boojum used to eat it for lunch everyday. It is pretty decent price I got a burrito with toppings and a drink for 12 euro and put hot sauce on it oh buddy it was fab.  It would keep me full when I was working | Staff are nice but the food is absolutely shocking. Definitely the worst boojum I have ever been to. Freezing cold, inedible, I threw it away because I felt sick eating it. Expensive mistake going here. It also took absolutely ages and the staff were in a bit of a faff because they were working on deliveroo orders. They handled it as best they could but I do not recommend this place to anyone anymore. Shame because it was good at one time! | It's a safe bet. Whenever you need someplace with healthy tasty food fast, you can rely on Boojum. Their plant based meat is really tasty. Has vegan options. | Fav spot, blues lost out after covid by not doing sauces at the table anymore and veg quality went down. Zambreros has lovely flavour. This place will make you wiggle your toes while you dig in. Large bowl quantities and one of the staff members is the most enthusiastic guy of all time he makes the burritos taste 10x better and deserves to be brand manager.
Titanic Bar and Grill is a Mexican restaurant in Cork. Customer reviews say: It was our first stop. Views were perfect, food delightful, very large portions, and the pint was perfect. Service was attentive,  kind and very efficient. We had fun exploring the small gift shop, and got some great photographs. | Not great at all, food is not good, loads of staff running around, zero organisation. The 3 of us found everything really dry. One of the group actually left everything on the plate it was so obvious, but the young girl clearing the table never asked was everything okGÇª I think she knew or was used to the reply.  Would never be back here | Kind, attentive staff.  Unfortunately on Sundays they only offer lunch, even for dinner. So I just had a glass of Guinness and sat on the patio. Its a decent view out there of the dock passengers crossed to board the Titanic. The dock is very old but not torn down as it's historic. You can't and wouldn't want to access it personally. Loads of history here and it offers a good space to reflect. The downside was the outdoor patio environment was drowned out by very loud and annoying music. Additionally there was a tour occurring so the tour guide was having to talk over that music on a headphone. Needless to say, I didn't hang out or finish my beer. But it was a nice moment while I could tolerate the noise pollution. | As a themed and tourist heavy restaurant, I had high hopes for the Titanic bar and grill and I rarely give a review below four stars as there are so many factors to consider...Generally speaking, one category or another keeps things afloat. That was not the case here.  Food 3/5 The seafood chowder was somewhat flavorful and contained a good amount of seafood, but the seafood itself was unfortunately overcooked, giving it a texture similar to canned chowder. It was served with bread that was extremely dry and disappointing. The other disappointment was the carrot soup. Also, served with a dry piece of bread, the soup lacked in flavor of any sort.  In contrast the burger and the fish and chips were both tasty well portioned.  Service 3/5 For a non busy time I would have expected that we would have had more attentive service. But the real dinger here was that servers could be seen hanging about the dining area chatting with each other and one of them was even picking their teeth (with their fingers) in plain view of customers.  The atmosphere is the winner. The restaurant is quite nice and has such potential for a good evening out. If only the food and service matched it. | Looking forward to visiting in the summer to fully enjoy the lovely decking outside. Just had a coffee there with a friend. Nice view by the window. Staff were lovely.
The Black Dog is a Mexican restaurant in Cork. Customer reviews say: We ordered the nachos, birria and corn. It was absolutely amazing. Massive portions so the staff were very kind to accept when we wanted to place a half porrion order for the corn. Will be dreaming of all of this and will deffo be coming back. Highly recommend. | I didnGÇÖt try the food here, but it looked really delicious. The drink was perfect. The staff were also very nice, and were all working very hard.  Nice atmosphere. Will definitely come here when in Cork. | Absolutely amazing experience 10/10 Food was tasty, surprisingly big portions, people working here are friendly, professional and have an impeccable rock music taste. Would definitely come back again and recommend to check it out. | This is my second time here and im not sure what happened but the food was so bland. The first time I visited I ordered the same thing and the pork tacos which was great. This time the beef birra tacos needed salt, it was tasteless and had so much cheese, I could only taste the cheese and not the beef. I had to drown my taco in their home made sauce so that it could have some flavor . We paid 46 euro in total with no alcoholic drinks, very steep for unseasoned bland Tacos. I have also visited their other premises in Pembroke street and really enjoyed it. I say this was a bad night and something went wrong . Really disappointed. We need to have the courage to sent food back if we not happy instead of just paying and eating food that is not up to standard, definitely going to do that next time if I go again or anywhere else. | Awesome tacos and great drinks at Black Dog Tacos! One of the few places in town where you can get really good quality tacos GÇö fresh, flavorful, and packed with tasty ingredients. The drinks are just as good, with a nice selection that goes perfectly with the food. The vibe is fun and relaxed, and the staff are welcoming. Definitely a go-to spot if youGÇÖre craving tacos and a great drink in Cork! =ƒî«=ƒì¦
Goldbergs is a Mexican restaurant in Cork. Customer reviews say: We had some seriously delicious brunch here at the weekend! This is a hidden gem right by the water. Great spot for a pint too if youGÇÖre that way inclined! | Very popular spot in the old 'Jewtown', hence the name of the place. When I went in a lot of tables were booked by neighbouring businesses for their Christmas nights out. | The place has got a very good vibe, a bit out of the center, with beautiful decorations. The food is really amazing and tasty =ƒññ I would say the only thing missing is a plant based milk option. (Just soya or oats would work). | This place is busy. We are almost at the holidays and the tables were all reserved for parties and functions. Standing room only so a friend of mine and I stood at the bar for a while until a couple of stools freed up. Since the parties at the bar were catered ordering food seemed difficult. We only had drinks and chatted nicely until the DJ came on and the music got louder. Then it got difficult to hear our conversation but we really enjoyed the music. 80's and 90's music which was nice and everyone started dancing. So much fun to be had and the dancers were in front of the door and getting out was a challenge. Overall my rating is 4 stars because we couldn't sample the menu. The drinks were good and the service was great. I will definitely return at a less busier time. | booked our Christmas party here, the staff and Lauren who we were dealing with were amazing , the food was excellent and really nice relaxed atmosphere, highly recommended
Salt Food & Wine is a Mexican restaurant in Cork. Customer reviews say: Salt Food & Wine is an excellent choice for brunch in Cork. The sunny terrace is a big plus, especially in Ireland, and the atmosphere is great. The food is spectacular, Ihad the Eggs Benedict, and my companion had the +ç-¦lb-¦r waffle (see photos). Both dishes were perfectly prepared and full of flavor. For dessert, we ordered the French toast, which is only available after 12 PM, and it was absolutely delicious. Our server, Oph+¬lie, was very attentive and made our experience even better. Highly recommende, | Really nice spot. Service is efficient, and the food is colourful and tasty. There are lots of options on the menu. Sitting outside is undercover, and there is a heater on and keep you warm. Definitely a great spot for brunch,l, but if you want to seat inside probably a good idea to book | I found myself visiting family in County Cork, out by Midleton. On a lazy Sunday morning, I decided to take a drive out to Cork city and grab brunch at a place I had read about. Salt is a great little neighbourhood spot.  Small but well formed, the place canGÇÖt help but be welcoming. I was served by Lizzie, who made me feel as if this was my umpteenth visit.  I ordered a flat white, orange juice, and the Huevos RancheroGÇª and boy, what a breakfast that was! Truly filling, warming, and set me up for a day out to Blarney and beyond.  Salt is a great spot in Cork. | Generous food portions and great service! We visited on a rainy day, so we ended up sitting indoors, but the atmosphere was still lovely. Would love to come back and try the terrace seating next time; it looks like the perfect spot to enjoy a nice meal with a view. | Amazing cozy place. Great menu and fantastic service. I tried their quesadillas and fries ! It was fantastic. Pink lemonade was also soo good. Ended by meal with the best apple crumble.
La Cantina Company is a Mexican restaurant in Cork. Customer reviews say: The "Pelua" is the best Arepa ever! Filled with juicy shredded beef and melted cheese, it has the perfect blend of flavors. Pairing it with a cold Malta drink makes for an unbeatable combination. Highly recommended! =ƒññ | The best thing you can get in marina Market! Lots of protein, so tasty and fresh! ItGÇÖs full of flavour! You just have to have an open minded to try it for the first time and trust me you will just keep coming back! My partner and I looooove it | Delicious food It had been years since I had eaten Venezuelan food and I must say that it met all my expectations! Well done Guys =ƒæÅ | This was my first time trying this kind of dish, and it was absolutely delicious. The sweet and savory flavor was so addictive that I want to have it again. The restaurant also had a great atmosphere, and the staff were all energetic and friendly. IGÇÖd love to visit again. | The empanadas and arepas have a lot of filling, everything is delicious! Meat, cheese, slices and Venezuelan sauces.
Paladar is a Mexican restaurant in Cork. Customer reviews say: What an absolutely fantastic experience. We sat at the bar and Adam our bartender was incredible. He helped us with great recommendations and every cocktail was perfect. I would definitely recommend making a reservation because it gets busy. We had the cabbage, guacamole, and cheese sandwiches and they were delicious. | Fantastic spot for a classy, well made cocktail. The vibes are immaculate and transport you far away from Rainy Ireland to a warmer Latin haven. The Bartender knew their business and walked us through picking our perfect cocktails for the evening. Prices are reasonable and straightforward. Sad the kitchen was already closed so we were unable to try their selection of tapas. | OMG, what can I say about Paladar other than AMAZING! Walking in, the decor, vibe and attention to detail is second to none. The host Gustavo is a special talent that's hard to come by. Friendly while trying to deal with a thousand things at once. Quick in his actions but delicate in how he works. We came at a busy time and had to wait for a seat but had a drink while waiting. And then there's the drinks!! The cocktails were glorious. You could also see at the bar how good they were at making them, the attention and skill involved. Adam particularly was really friendly and showed his ability at making a good drink. Can't rate this place higher. Must go to while in Cork! | Everything about this spot was perfect!  We hadn't booked so got a small bar stool table which was still comfortable. We ordered 5 of small plates and the pork tacos to share. My cocktail was incredible and well explained by the server who was enthusiastic, friendly and well versed. The market fish tostadas were our stand out dish, but the rest of the dishes were also very good. My only slight criticism would be that I wanted a little more spice - but that's personal preference!  Really enjoyable and highly recommend! We might be back! | Arrived around 8pm on a busy Saturday night. They managed to fit us in without reservation (on a shared table)  Service: Man with the big beard was excellent, provided great recommendations and was friendly throughout.  Food:  The small plate pork belly was incredible! It literally blew us away with the flavours!!! 5/5  We got two shared plates: 1. Peruvian fried chicken Slightly salty but had good flavours. Rice was tasty, probably the best part of the dish. All in all, it didnGÇÖt wow us. 3/5  2. Seared Prawns A unique dish, the prawns come cold with carrots, onions and even strawberries! The broth had lots of flavour however, we werenGÇÖt too impressed with the prawns. 3/5  Dessert: Flan de Coco Underwhelming, didnGÇÖt taste of much. Highlight is the honeycomb.  Atmosphere: Small and cosy vibe. Music was a tad bit too loud, couldnGÇÖt converse that well. Cool Latin American theme throughout the restaurant. Toilets were spotless.
Oak Fire Pizza - Princes Street is a Mexican restaurant in Cork. Customer reviews say: Made the mistake of looking at reviews online before coming here, it meant we already had our pizzas eyed up and particularly the breadsticks, it all amounted to a lot of food but as the nice lady serving us said we can have the leftovers for breakfast. The breadsticks were totes amaze and is definitely worth getting if you head this way. The pizzas were brilliant, cooked to perfection, I ordered the carnivore pizza which came with black pudding so I was a very full boy pretty soon. The girlfriend ordered the Emilia and wouldnGÇÖt let me try her pizza which means it must have been good. Quite a small establishment but the guys there made us feel very welcome and insisted we move to a bigger table to feel more comfortable | Tempted by good reviews, she came to the pizzeria on her son's birthday. I was expecting a delicious pizza, but I was disappointed. The pizza was terribly wet and it was impossible to hold it in your hand. The ingredients were flowing And I ate this unfortunate pizza with the help of a fork. I had tomato soup on my plate. | Tried the Carnivore. The crust lacked that satisfying snapGÇöcrispy on the edge but soggy in the middle, possibly from an overheated oven. The sauce played it too safe, missing any real punch. Toppings were heavy-handed, with too much cheese overwhelming the rest. Overall, it felt more like a missed opportunity than a bold bite. | Oak Fire Pizza GÇô simply the best! Hands down one of the best pizzas IGÇÖve ever had! The crust was perfectly crisp, the toppings were fresh and flavorful, and you can really taste the quality in every bite. The staff were super friendly and the vibe was relaxed and welcoming. ItGÇÖs the kind of place you instantly want to come back to. Whether youGÇÖre a local or just visiting Cork City, Oak Fire Pizza is an absolute must! =ƒìò=ƒöÑ | Leo could not have been more accommodating. Friendly, calm, and genuinely sound on the phone, he gave great recommendations and made us feel completely welcome rather than rushed.  In a fast-paced world, Leo represents old-school service GÇö looking after the common person with warmth and respect. HeGÇÖs a credit to Oak Fire Pizzas.  An absolute gent. We hope he goes far
Brendans Burritos is a Mexican restaurant in Cork. Customer reviews say: Unreal burrito and lovely really genuine customer service from Norton and Donna. I tried to leave a review at the Wilton store but couldn't figure out how.  Really great value for good food. One of the better places in Wilton for lunch for sure! But definitely the vibe from Norton and Donna was great have to say will defo come back cuz of them! | I really enjoyed the burrito here. They had vegetarian and vegan options, as well as meat. This thing was BIG. Kind of wish they had a junior version. The thing was heavy to lift. =ƒÿé Given the environment of the Black Market, they really just hand it to you wrapped up. No tray or additional silverware or anything. The burrito was very tasty. Though I would argue that Gé¼8.50 for a burrito is a bit steep, but I guess thatGÇÖs inflation. =ƒñ+GÇìGÖén+Å=ƒÿû | A great find, from the Gluten Free perspective in Cork City.  Brendans Burritos offers affordable selections of all types of burritos, quesadilla, and nacho dishes for the portion and quality of delicious foods. | Got the black pudding and egg burrito =ƒî» - absolutely delicious no complaints. Also got the strawberry sundae which was nice and super cold =ƒì¿ | Words cannot fathom how much of an amazing service I had today with a lovely girl. Eilish was her name and Erika . What a great service and professional lady. The nacho bowl was to die for. Would deffo come back.
Tequila Jack's Mexican Restaurant & Tequila Bar is a Mexican restaurant in Cork. Customer reviews say: Absolutely loved my birthday meal here. Staff were so accommodating and our food was with us in no time. The cocktails are second to none. The whole decor and everything about Tequila Jacks is so inviting. What a vibe | Yesterday evening I had the pleasure of dining in the dome at Tequila JackGÇÖs. From the minute I made contact to book the dome for dinner and drinks, I knew I would have an amazing experience. The food was delicious, there was a large array of cocktails to choose from. Each item that was put on front of me was presented with such care and attention to detail. The staff gave us lots of attention and made sure we had everything we needed. The dome itself provided privacy and comfort. The staff ensured that the lighting and heating was to our satisfaction also. The views of the city hall and surrounding area through the dome was beautiful. Seeing the colourful lights of the city hall, bridge and buildings added to the atmosphere created by Tequila JackGÇÖs staff. I will most definitely be back! IGÇÖm only so sorry it took me so long to get there in the first place. Thank you for such a lovely experience. | I am really disappointed with our most recent visit. This used to be one of our favourite places to catch up, but the experience this time was poor from start to finish.  Even though we had a reservation and arrived early, we still waited about past our booking time to be seated. Partway through our meal we were asked to move our table backwards so a band could set up behind us, even though they did not start playing until right before we left. The music in the restaurant was already very loud, and the setup happening directly behind us made it extremely difficult to have a normal conversation.  Service was slow all evening. There were long delays between dishes, and it was difficult to get anyoneGÇÖs attention even to order drinks. My mixed meat fajitas cost 24 euro and were disappointing. The chicken portion was very disappointing size wise, and the steak was undercooked. I was not asked how I wanted it cooked, and the staff seemed far too busy to address it.  What made this even more frustrating is that I emailed the restaurant privately on the 21st to share this feedback and never received a reply. After several great visits in the past, this experience and the complete lack of acknowledgement makes me very hesitant to return | We came on Saturday for dinner for two. Nice tables, plenty of space, but the food is the same as everywhere else in Cork; we didn't notice anything Mexican. The restroom isn't very clean, but the staff are pleasant. | We went here for a work meal and a few drinks. The staff were very accommodating, the music afterwards as it got later was really good. The food came out nice and fast and everybody enjoyed it. Would defiantly come back. We had a set menu, 2 courses for Gé¼36 euro (because of the large group). Defiantly worth it.
Hillbilly's MacCurtain Street is a Mexican restaurant in Cork. Customer reviews say: My favourite fast food place . Clean and tidy seat down area . Amazing food all day long ! Just a smile from the staff will make it perfect ! | ordered two 3 piece chicken tender meals earlier, was really looking forward to it as i absolutely love the hilbillies chips, unfortunately, i was left devastated when i opened the bag to find not one, but two missing bags of chips, which was definately not what i paid for (31.50). i think hillbillies is a great food place and i love the quality of the food, so i was disappointed. tried to ring the chain multiple times, and received no pick up. i'm very sad as i was really hungry. | Waited at counter for 10 min server Did not even greet me. Understood she was busy but a hello letGÇÖs someone know your aware of them. Has dropped a lot since I was last here. | Management please read Was in hillbilly's about midnight on Oct 25th and all I can say is whatever you're paying your staff it's not enough! Burger and chips were lovely but the staff....they remained polite, helpful and efficient in the middle of a very busy atmosphere with a lot of less than polite customers. Well done! | At just under Gé¼11 euros. From all the HillBillys visited this restaurant that serves the Classic Breast in the bun meal, has to top the rest of them the chips served with the meal were an improvement on the other establishments visited. Spacious seating inside for dinning as takeaways go. The few extra chips added in were welcomed, which is a Irish tradition here in Ireland almost balanced the meal. As for the service there was no que only one or two people waiting and the service was spot on. The food served quickly and presented was fresh and delicious and served surprisingly quick. Best Hillbillys visited so far.
Zambrero Sallybrook is a Mexican restaurant in Cork. Customer reviews say: The staff went above and beyond for my autistic son who loves zambrero but only eats plan cheese quesadilla thank you so much for making him feel so happy | Staff here are really helpful and lovely to deal with | Nice and delicious.Friendly staffs | Allie is the best !! So friendly | 
Cr+¿me French Tacos is a Mexican restaurant in Cork. Customer reviews say: Food is truly delightful, and while the preparation process can often be time-consuming, the overall experience of enjoying a meal is incredibly rewarding. The anticipation that builds while waiting for a dish to cook only heightens the pleasure when it's finally served. Each bite can transport you to different cultures and memories, making the wait worthwhile. Ultimately, the joy of sharing a meal with friends or family enhances the experience even further, turning it into a cherished moment rather than just a necessity. | I absolutely love French Tacos! Their tacos are always incredibly delicious GÇö full of flavor and perfectly made every time. Every time I go, I always order from them because the food never disappoints. The atmosphere is very calm and relaxing, making it a great place to enjoy a meal. Plus, everything is super clean, which makes the experience even better. Highly recommended if youGÇÖre looking for tasty food and a comfortable spot to eat! | The very tasty Lyon Taco for the very filling price of Gé¼12.50 the fries chips cost Gé¼3.95 and you get a free mineral. The French Taco is the tidiest taco I have eaten so far compared to other tacos. Everything in the filling with the fromagere sauce keeps it all together. So none of it is wasted and that messiness that usually comes with tacos and kebabs doesn't happen. Great value a very small dinning in area but great for a takeaway as it is prepared quickly and served by nice and friendly staff that explained the ingredients. Lots of other options on the menu. As for the atmosphere the music is nice and low. The area is busy and clean enough. A very filling and delicious meal. | Ordered for take away, and it was soooo goood.G£¿ The place is nice and tidy, crew is very friendly and nice, preparation was quick. You can also order at a kiosk in the restaurant which makes things easier. The price is very fair, you get a really filling taco for around Gé¼12, they have a great variety of menu items too. The taco was very delicious and filling and had a lot of meat and not so much fries =ƒìƒ which is great. The taco is saucy and perfectly balanced, there is not too much of anything in there. All in all great place and can only recommend them G£¿Gÿÿn+Å | Best tasty food, nice staff, not that expensive. Just perfect
Boojum - Blanchardstown is a Mexican restaurant in Dublin. Customer reviews say: Portion sizes have taken a big hit in recent times, I reckon it's probably because of inflation etc but just feel cheated. It was really a go to restaurant for takeaways but I have to reconsider going forward. The vegetarian options suffer especially as the servers put the same amount of rice/ beans despite lack of meat leaving the box/ burrito half empty. | We have visited Boojum for the first time in a long time yesterday and i couldnGÇÖt believe the price i paid. The food is delicious and my portion was big but to pay Gé¼33 for 2 items was extreme. I got my usual nachos with chili , salsa , guacamole and pickled onion and then just a cheese and chicken burrito with rice. The food is delicious i must say but the prices are extreme. I have gotten food poisoning from the chicken there before as it was undercooked but i canGÇÖt fault them as it has only happened once to me. I think their nachos are delicious and there are lots of options to choose from. | Got there when I immediately opened. Was able to order easily and the staff where friendly and efficient. The burrito tasted great and the ingredients fresh. Two burritos cost approx Gé¼20 - 25 which is on the pricer side. I also noticed a price difference with the app so I don't know if something was priced different in store. | Food was stone cold when received. Not the first time. The law requires food to be hot held at 63 degrees Celsius. I had to do add my food. | The service provided was really rude, to start off they added the wrong thing to my burrito which didnGÇÖt bother me as I ate what was added but then food was just thrown together, there was no hello or anything just a GÇ£what do you wantGÇ¥. then when paying for it there wasnGÇÖt a single word said no thank you or anything, I was stood there for a minute not realising I had to tap my card as I didnGÇÖt even know she had put the order through yet as she didnGÇÖt look up once, it was all just very rude and there was quite lot of rubbish on tables and we ended up eating at a table with the previous customers rubbish. The food was very nice but the service was awful.
Fuppin Delish is a Mexican restaurant in Dublin. Customer reviews say: What an awful tacos =ƒÖä I wasn't hoping for true Mexican food, I was at least hoping for something tex-mex like, but it was tasteless, quite expensive to what you receive. Very disappointing. If you've ever been in Mexico or in any authentic taqueria in Europe you would not like it. | Great nachos are full of flavour and very nice portions. I also tried the burritos. I enjoyed it a lot. Great atmosphere located in Humphrey's Pub. | My tacos were tasty, generously filled and really well made. I highly recommend them. Funnily enough, while I was trying to find the place, I overheard a stranger who was walking the other way tell her friend that GÇ£the place with the really good tacos is over thereGÇ¥. They werenGÇÖt wrong!  Also, the bar you walk through to get to Fuppin Delish was lively, and the waiting staff were super attentive. So, youGÇÖve got the whole package! | One of the best places... I been trying a lot of Mexican restaurants in Dublin... I think that this is one of the best.. pork tacos are amazing and it's a plus that they even make the tortillas =ƒÿè | Some of the best pub food I've had , great food truck out the back of Humphreys in Ranelagh.  Lovely Mexican food , they also do burgers, Toasties and wings.  It's all great quality and really tasty. The nachos are my favourite
Tula Mexican Grill is a Mexican restaurant in Dublin. Customer reviews say: This place is amazing and very bright =ƒîP. The furniture is also good and it is spacious. The menu is nice and affordable with great taste =ƒÿï. In 10 - 15 euros one can get anything and it is awesome =ƒæî. They also have amazing range of beverages. Most important thing is it is open till morning 5. Thus if one is doing party at temple bar this is a very good place to eat something tasty in reasonable price =ƒÿï | My friend and I were looking for some quick take away food and came across Tula Mexican Grill. IGÇÖm very glad we did go inside. ItGÇÖs located perfectly near the famous Temple Bar.  I ordered a quesadilla with pulled beef and some extra guacamole, it was very enjoyable and filling (and IGÇÖm a big eater). The seating area and kitchen looked clean and the employees were very kind!  Price/ quality ratio was very great, compared to other places near the restaurant. Overall experience 5/5!! | Yeah, so I ordered delivery twice, both of those times the food was very salty. Not sure if itGÇÖs the meat seasoning or the salsa the second time that I got my order wrong and they did not include the tofu that I selected. I think their seasoning is OK, I actually really do like the tofu seasoning, but it is on the salt to your side. But I suppose this is a healthier option for those you wanna customizetheir own bowls. Guacamole also tasted good. | Tula does a good burrito - they do frequent two for one deals and I sometimes wish they just lowered their prices a touch instead - they are higher than other fast lunch options. That said, only Boojum can compete for title of best burrito in Dublin and itGÇÖs always quick service. | I had the best burrito in Dublin so far. It was a very good quantity and it was incredibly tasty and fresh. Not only that but the guacamole was incredible, i could feel the freshness of the coliander the lemon that I havenGÇÖt found in many Mexican restaurants. I have no idea why Tula doesnGÇÖt have better ratings, why the hell did I spend my money on zambrero burritos this whole time?? Zambrero is a solid 2/5 compared to this
Adobo Mexico is a Mexican restaurant in Dublin. Customer reviews say: Genuinely exciting to eat. Beautiful, authentic flavours. We got the pork tacos (pictured) and beef burrito. A massive loss to Malahide but weGÇÖll be back to parkside! | Collected food from here now 4 or 5 times and each time it is unreal. We have had Mexican food in many places and over many years but this is one of the best we've ever tasted. A local gem!!! | Great food every time we order and right on our step.  Get out there and support the good in your neighbourhood folks.  My missus is crying out for the shrimp she saw you guys making on your social media though. | A real gem for anyone who fancies true mexican cuisine. The best ingredients makes the best mexican dishes. I ordered the trio chicken tacos and the chicken flutes, and it came with a side of nachos from corn tortillas. Tastes great, not pricey, served with a smile. | Only real question is, would I get it again? The answer is definitely.  Beef and Pork was nicer than the chicken. Portion size and present was good.  I think mango salsa or mexicana crema or something freshen the pallet would be nice.
Mr Burrito Dublin is a Mexican restaurant in Dublin. Customer reviews say: The restaurant is small, cosy, a little bit cold. The customer service is fine. I ordered Chicken Fajita, however I didn't like the way chicken is cooked and prepared for the upcoming orders. The Fajita missed some tastes which I think they are big part of Mex food. | Fresh food, quick service and a fair price. Very happy with the quality of the burritos and ingredients here, you can really feel the weight in each one just holding it! Superb way to get some good food fast, will definitely return here when i am in the area. 5/5 stars, nice atmosphere also! | Lovely small and cosy Mexican restaurant. I really enjoyed the vegetarian burrito easily turned vegan (no cheese and no sour cream). The ingredients taste much better than chain Mexican places, they're of higher quality and/ or made with more attention. One of the best plant based burritos I have had in Dublin. Few seats available for dine in and each table equipped with a bottle of spicy salsa sauce. I'll be back for sure. | Food is OK definitely filling and the burritos where full but quite expensive in comparison to competitors. The man serving is very grumpy and rude his customer service certainly needs work, a smile or a thank you wouldn't hurt. | best burrito in the country never fails to amaze my taste buds =ƒÆ»=ƒöÑ. great service and quality food highly recommended G¡Én+ÅG¡Én+ÅG¡Én+ÅG¡Én+ÅG¡Én+Å.
Pablo Picante Californian Burrito Bar is a Mexican restaurant in Dublin. Customer reviews say: Lovely burrito =ƒî». Not very expensive, either. A very good grab-and-go option. I tried the bean and cheese burrito  with extra jalape+¦os. | This place is much much better than Boojum. Food quality was really good and they've plenty of options on the menu. It's a little bit pricey but sure where isn't these days, but it's worth it for what you get. Really tasty and fresh ingredients in my burrito bowl. Would like if they would open more outlets more around Dublin as they're only in the city centre. | ordered a chicken burrito here yesterday and the chicken was pink. Took 2 bites before I noticed- hoping I don't get sick today. Got a refund and advised the staff to not serve the chicken to anyone else | Barbacoa bowl was room temperature, beans on the bottom were cold. Not even warm enough to melt the cheese on top. This was takeaway, not delivery so I know it wasnGÇÖt riding around on a bike getting cold, it was served this way. Hoping for the best tomorrow. | Ordered a burrito. Beef barbacoa.  What they lack in flavor, they compensate for it with hefty amounts of volume.  The flavors are bland.  The type of burrito thatGÇÖs enticing to start, but after 6 bites in, youGÇÖre questioning whether it was worth the effort.  Not enjoyable.
Boojum - George's Street is a Mexican restaurant in Dublin. Customer reviews say: Chipotle copycat.  Staff were pleasant and fast.  I questioned some hygiene practices here that doomed Chipotle stockholders in the U.S.  Price is def more expensive than those found in the U.S.  Portions may vary depending on who is serving you. The cashier at the front desk is not consistent with charging customers (my sister and I ordered the same identical EXACT food, however she was charged 8 Euros and I was charged 7.45 Euros).  We would not come back here again but it was worth a try for first visitors when there is nothing else to eat). | Very nice restaurant and pocket friendly menu. =ƒÿâ their burritos =ƒî» are amazing and also i love their burrito bowls. In 10 euro in 1 burrito bowl you can have so much food that it is sufficient for 2 times =ƒÿâ | Disappointing experience. The staff member didnGÇÖt greet me and put a very small amount of meat in my burrito GÇö barely half a spoon. For Gé¼12, the portion felt closer to a kidsGÇÖ size. Poor service and bad value for money. | My favourite and the best boojum to eat at in Dublin. I appreciate Jos+¬ and DanielGÇÖs service, everytime I come in they greet me with a smile and a small chat. Overall I love how friendly the staff is here.  Food is always prepared quickly and there is a very short waiting time even during rush hour. Highly recommend coming to this Boojum | Staff seem really angry, one stared me down when I said I wanted spicy chicken and not regular chicken. My burrito was not wrapped properly and they donGÇÖt take cash. DonGÇÖt recommend.
Papi Chulo is a Mexican restaurant in Dublin. Customer reviews say: We ordered two burritos ; vegan & chicken and some nachos.  We received two chicken burritos, one was meant to be without pico, again both had pico.  I really donGÇÖt understand where the miscommunication was. When ordering it felt like we were also judged for our choices; less judging, more listening would be my advice. | i went today and everything was excellent, and they have a discount for students. The costume service was perfect and they were really kind, also the sauces were tasty. I ordered a nachos with fries and was really good. Definitely i come back again, to try the burritos. | I could cry real tears after finding delicious Mexican food in Ireland. Nachos could use a bit more toppings and a few fewer chips (and more nacho chips) but I am not going to split hairs too much. Just what I was craving! The carnitas breakfast burrito was fab as well. | IGÇÖve been here twice. First time - super friendly staff, substantial amount of meat in the burrito, very tasty. Thought IGÇÖd found a new favourite burrito place. Second time - where is my chicken and chorizo? =ƒÿó A tiny bit of chicken, couldnGÇÖt see any chorizo, mostly rice which was bland. Very disappointed. Bizarrely, the staff member on check out would only stamp my loyalty card once despite buying two burrito meals. I was told the policy is one stamp per order. Not that itGÇÖs a concern as I canGÇÖt imagine IGÇÖll be back unless itGÇÖs the staff from my first visit the week previous. Nice little seating area. They charge extra for things IGÇÖd consider basic like cheese. | Fantastic food in a great little place at the end of the tram line. On a short break from the UK and staying in the area. I had the burrito which even for a big eater like myself, was very tasty and filling. All good was prepared on site so was fresh and hot when served.
El Grito Mexican Taqueria is a Mexican restaurant in Dublin. Customer reviews say: I have tried Mexican food for the first time in their Mountjoy square restaurant and it was the place that made me love Mexican food. Happy now that they opened this restaurant in Rathmines and kept the same quality. My favourite in this restaurant is obviously their hot sausages. They have quite a lot variety of hot sauces =ƒÿï Regarding the food, as I like slow cooked meat, my favourite meet is Barbacoa. In the photos you will see Chimichanga which is deep fried burrito. A few extra calories worth the taste | Food is authentic and very tasty. Nachos come in a good portion and feel homemade. The alambre plate looked a little small at the beginning but itGÇÖs very filling and the meat is delicious and extra tender. The vegan tostadota was superb, the mix of veggies makes it extremely tender and the portion is also generous. Service is excellent, super welcoming and attentive. Only little downside I would say itGÇÖs the small tables but other than that itGÇÖs an excellent place | Beautiful traditional mexican food and decor. Nice staff very polite and attentive.  Very nice modern artwork depicting Mexican scenes on the wall and lovely Mexican music playing in the background.. a great addition to the restaurants in rathmines. Top marks | Extremely tasty and very filling, we had a lovely evening here, the staff were lovely and very polite, the food was so good and very authentic, the solero cocktail was delicious and the price overall was very reasonable, we'll definitely be back soon =ƒÑ¦ | Great experience overall. The staff were friendly, energised, and made the place feel very welcoming. The burrito bowl was really interesting GÇö itGÇÖs essentially a baked wrap served as a bowl, which made it easy and enjoyable to eat. Portions were generous and good value for the price. Would definitely come back.
Chubbys is a Mexican restaurant in Dublin. Customer reviews say: Been here twice now since reopening and itGÇÖs all round 10/10, first time we got the beef rib and oh my god IGÇÖve never had anything like this, was so delicious and huge, brought home leftovers and made a sambo was amazing. The corn ribs are outstanding, flavours are unreal, we got these both times. The birria chips I wouldnGÇÖt get again as went very soggy but flavours were good. Nachos were really nice, maybe worth mention the tiny guac portion for Gé¼3.50 not really worth it and more cheese sauce would be good, weGÇÖre still really good, spicy. Birria tacos sooo comforting, taste was perfect, balance was perfect. The honey soy chicken was also unbelievable, super crispy even with the sauce and pretty spicy. Sticky toffee pudding spring rolls were tasty but they were quite cold when we got them on the first visit. Was dying to give them a second go but was soooo full on our second visit. Drinks were pretty good. CanGÇÖt wait to return again when I can manage to get a booking=ƒÿ¡ also would love to see takeaway option=ƒ¬+ | The service and speed of food leaving the kitchen let it down during our visit. One attentive foh staff member who had little enthusiastic support on the day.  Food itself was only okay, some hits (lamb flatbread) and some misses (loaded fries). Cocktails read well but weren't our buzz.  Restaurant itself is beautifully designed and the tunes are on point, but they need to fix the signage so people aren't consistently trying to open a locked door next to the table in the window.  After waiting 3 months for a table and coming across the city for it, maybe our group had hyped it up too much, but gutted to say it wasn't the meal we were expecting. | We had dinner here after reading the really positive review in the Irish Independant. The atmosphere was lively, the staff were absolutely excellent, friendly and helpful and the food was nice, just not the experience I expected it to be. The portion sizes for the pork roll and beef Mulita were not very big for the price (Gé¼12 and Gé¼11 respectively), and the garlic butter and parmesan fries, whilst a good size portion and tasty, were very expensive at Gé¼11.50!! Also, I do have an issue with restaurants charging Gé¼3.50 for a tiny 200ml Coca Cola. It's just too much! The nice service really did stand out though, cheers to lovely server Rob. | Tonight I went to Chubbys and tasted half their menu. Ooh, wooow! The atmosphere is cozy/professional/great. The staff is friendly and prompt. Everything about this place immediately tells you how good it is going to be.  Then the food... Just stop!! All the dishes were mouth watering and finger on lickin'. I started with a cocktail; Sichuan Cherry Manhattan, which was perfect. Then, in short order, there arrived such an array of flavour and tast that my mouth exploded with delight. Everything from simple corn on the cob - corn ribs, to lmab on charred flatbread with generous amounts of perfectly balanced toppings, to Indian tasty fried chicken and more, all was delicious. I went all the way beyond my capacity to a sweet and savory desert with chocolate, nuts, ice cream and butter scotch sauce. I don't even do this meal justice trying to describe it.  It is safe to say I absolutely recommend this place. You will be grateful for every bite from each if their dishes. | Waited a while to try this & was not disappointed- had the nachos with birra to start - so good & good size portion to share. Then had a chicken burger and nduja fries - both properly delicious. Had the most delicious non alcoholic cocktail, the kind of one youGÇÖd choose even if you drank. The bill was exactly as expected, great produce & location. WeGÇÖll definitely be back.
Tula Mexican Grill is a Mexican restaurant in Dublin. Customer reviews say: Quite a good spot for some Mexican food. The food is fresh and tastes delicious. You will have options to choose the type of protein and you can add it to your bowl/tacos/burrito. ThereGÇÖs a decent amount of seating space both indoors and outdoors. The staff is polite and the service is quick. | Had a great meal.  Staff was friendly and helpful. My only comment is the music is very loud and makes it hard to hold a conversation.  I would go back! | IGÇÖve been to Tula in Ballsbridge many times, and the staff is always amazing and the food consistently delicious. But this time I probably had one of the best burritos ever, thanks to Monica! Both Monica and Vanessa were really friendly and welcoming, and as always, the atmosphere was great. The burritos here are always delicious, and itGÇÖs one of those places you just keep coming back to. Highly recommend! | Good things should be said. Every time I go from Monday to Friday, the service is always great. ThereGÇÖs a guy named Joel who always stands out for being especially friendly and attentive. A few days ago, I forgot my extra guacamole, and he actually came running after me to give it to me such a kind gesture. Overall, the food is excellent and the whole team provides great service. Joel is a great example of the positive attitude the staff has. Keep it up! | Went in for a burrito after a few pints across the street. Staff was friendly and service was quick. But for a Gé¼15+ burrito there was way more rice than beef as they ran out of the pulled beef. What made that worse was the rice was half cooked, and not pleasant to bite into. A miss sadly.
Tacos by Agave is a Mexican restaurant in Dublin. Customer reviews say: Fantastic taqueria! The tacos are delicious, full of flavour and  for that price there is nothing better in Dublin. Made right in front of you with fresh ingredients. The place is small and it fills up quickly, just order your tacos, eat them and off you go with a smile in your face. Thank you boys for a lovely service and talking to me in Spanish. Que viva Mexico! G¥ñn+Å | I had an amazing experience at Agave. I ordered the Swiss enchiladas and they were absolutely delicious GÇö full of flavor, perfectly cooked, and beautifully presented. The staff service was incredible as well: friendly, attentive, and genuinely welcoming. Definitely a place IGÇÖll be coming back to. Highly recommended! | I got the food delivered. Such tasty tacos! So much flavour and fresh. They were better than I was expecting. | Absolutely love this place. Gé¼10 for 5 tacos. To the lovely stranger who paid for our food - thank you!!!! G¥ñn+Å | Good burrito and nice spot overall. Just wish there was a bit more space, only three chairs at the table. One more would make it perfect for two couples =ƒæì=ƒÅ+
Noah & Co is a Mexican restaurant in Dublin. Customer reviews say: Went to this place for a quick bite with family. The place is spacious and has got good ambience. The varieties of food was nice but I found it a bit on the expensive side. I ordered a Korean Chicken Burger which came with fries, the burger was ok but some of the fries was not cooked properly. This place definitely needs some improvement. | I had the hash with poached egg with some tea and the food came out quick and well cooked. Crispy potatoes, perfectly poached egg, bits of chorizo and rashers was perfect pop of flavour! Staff was very nice, attentive, and helpful. I was lucky to be here on a sunny morning and the seat by the window was perfect. Highly recommend for a relaxed breakfast solo or even with friends and family. | Very expensive =ƒ½¦ My mam and me got a grilled ham &cheese and it was very greasy it was nice but very greasy !! Less butter on the toasties on top please . Our hands were full grease afterwards My brother had a fry he liked it bu rashers were bit burnt and crispy so he found it hard to eat bu everything else was nice for him | Good sized portion breakfast for the price. All the food was very good, but I wish you could get brunch all day! | Really poor food type of food you get at an old service station with restaurant price tag.never again..looks like the lid fell off the spice shaker and ruined the fries and they served them anyway
Zambrero Liffey Valley is a Mexican restaurant in Dublin. Customer reviews say: Good Mexican food in terms of quality, portion and taste . I ordered the quesadilla stack this was good they give you options of beef, pork, chili and you can stuff it with filling. I also ordered a side of nachos which were once again filled with pork, gauc, sour cream and other toppings. A total with for your money. I will be back here.the staff here is also nice. | IGÇÖve ordered from this place a few times and the food itself is fine, but the delivery is consistently disappointing. It often takes ages, even when the estimated time is much shorter. ItGÇÖs really frustrating to be kept waiting every time. A bit more reliability and respect for delivery times would make a huge difference. | I've gotten coffee in Zambrero before while waiting for my bus but first time having lunch there, the staff are lovely and prices are alright but oh my God this is probably the dullest selection I've ever seen for a burrito place, I've seen independent examples with much more selection. The food is fine, nothing to cry home to though and the portions were I suppose standard enough but I didn't feel as full when finishing my meal - a burrito bowl with chicken - as I usually would when eating the same meal elsewhere | Never eaten zambero and staff member didnGÇÖt get his name (ordered at 12 on Sunday 2 November) was so helpful in explaining every item. I tipped him as he as so nice | I work in the center and 9 times out of 10 get my lunch here! The food is top quality and always super consistent, the staff are lovely too! Emily in particular is always so kind and polite to every customer, and she  is super efficient too! Give that girl a raise!! Great burritos and staff 10/10 would recommended
Masa Camden St is a Mexican restaurant in Dublin. Customer reviews say: =ƒîƒ=ƒîƒ=ƒîƒ=ƒîƒ=ƒîƒ Had a lovely experience here yesterday! The atmosphere was cozy and welcoming, the service was excellent, and the food was absolutely delicious. Everything ran smoothly, and I felt truly looked after. You can feel the care in every detail. Highly recommend! =ƒÆ¢  (=ƒô+ Sharing a photo because the dish looked and tasted amazing!) | Definitely the best taco IGÇÖve had in a long time! The flavor was incredible, everything super fresh and well prepared. The service was outstandingGÇª everyone was so friendly and attentive. Plus, the atmosphere is great: cozy and with such a nice vibe. Highly recommend! | Lovely restaurant with so delicious food and such a good vibe! We walked in on a Friday and was served right away. The staff was sweet and welcoming, especially our server Eimear. Thank you for a wonderful night! | Excellent service received. Staff were full of smiles , the food arrived quickly , fresh & hot and was overall a great experience! Highly recommend this to anyone! | What a restaurant! One of the best tacos IGÇÖve had in Dublin, especially the fish taco, which won my heart! Great spot for a happy hour, with excellent service and a great atmosphere too! IGÇÖll definitely be coming back more often!
Tula Mexican Grill is a Mexican restaurant in Dublin. Customer reviews say: Excellent food and a friendly staff. Prices very reasonable. | Amazing place! The burritos are super tasty. The staff is absolutely friendly, attentive, and always make you feel welcome!  I highly recommend it! =ƒî»GÖÑn+Å | Amazing place. The burritos are incredible and the staff are fantastic. TheyGÇÖre so friendly, and the location itself is very central. I visited Tula yesterday and I chose to create my own burrito. The service was so fast and I will definitely be back again soon on my break from work. | I had a great impression of this lovely place. All of the staff are kind and friendly. I decided to try a burrito, and it was the best I've ever had=ƒî». I highly recommend it.=ƒæî=ƒÅ+ Don't hesitate, friends, and come enjoy a delicious meal=ƒÿï | I had such a lovely time at Tula Mexican Restaurant! The food was amazing and the vibes were great. The staff was really kind and friendly. CanGÇÖt wait to come back!
Zambrero Long Mile Road is a Mexican restaurant in Dublin. Customer reviews say: Great food here. I had the Nachos with chipotle chicken. Really tasty. Super guacamole which looked really fresh and tasted amazing. I will definitely be back again. | For the price point, which is on par with boojum, zambrero is not on par for the taste or portion size of the competition. Everything was strictly portion controlled with a tiny cup. Including the rice, onions, and tomatoes. Gé¼16 on a bowl, tortillas and guac, and I was still hungry after. This would never happen with boojum. The service was good, the guy was polite and everything looked super clean/hygienic. | I love zambrero but the portion sizes in this one are waaay out for what you are paying, Gé¼2 for a teaspoon not even a mouthful of guacamole. I always go to the one on the Fonthill road always generous with their portions, here I asked for a little more guacamole and sour cream and even had to ask for extra protein because what i was given would probably cover about 7 nachos =ƒÖâ ill stick to the Fonthill =ƒæî
Vida's - Mexican Cantina and Cocktail Bar is a Mexican restaurant in Dublin. Customer reviews say: I mean... You have to go! The waitress was excellent suggesting and explaining offers of the day.  Tried tacos birria and they were simply delicious. Got a side with rice and pinto beans that paired perfectly! Will come back to ass a cocktail soon!  The food came out hot, very quickly and all together.  Definitely recommend for Mexican food, as well as friendly and environment (all Spanish speaking bans, loved it!)  Looking forward to next time! | I have to say this place is a 10/10. I will admit I have a bias for Mexican food. ItGÇÖs hard for me to leave with a bad taste in my mouth but this place is so good.  We unfortunately ate all the nachos and jalape+¦o poppers before I remembered to take a pic and started on the tacos too but it was so good.  The nachos we got the full portion and theyGÇÖre big. I wouldGÇÖve liked a bit more guac and pico de gallo but other than that very generous. Full of flavour. Even the tortilla chips you could see were covered in flavour. The guac and sour cream were super fresh as well as the pico de Gallo.  The jalape+¦o peppers were the best IGÇÖve had so far. Most places do it wrong and get the jalape+¦o ruined or leave the skin but no spice or lack cheese or come soggy but these were served on top of a chipotle sauce I think and still were crispy. The cheese was delicious though I couldGÇÖve used a little more and the sauce was really nice with the jalape+¦o. Worked to cool your mouth a little.  The tacos were so good. I wouldGÇÖve liked some more veg with them like pico de gallo cause they were protein heavy but the flavour was amazing. The sauce they came with was so good too. It was a smoky tomato flavour and I nearly wouldGÇÖve drank it. They were so worth it.  Considering all we got the price wasnGÇÖt bad bar the drinks, Gé¼4 for small soft drinks is a rip. The staff were super friendly, checking in and making sure everything is ok. They definitely deserve a raise for their customer service skills. As well of the chefs for their cooking skills too of course. Delicious.  It was also quiet on a Sunday evening which was nice. Made for a nice atmosphere. Very chilled. | The food was absolutely delicious! We loved the tacos and burritos. Rebeca was a fantastic host GÇô she made us feel so comfortable and helped us choose what to eat. We're definitely coming back! | Great place with an awesome atmosphere and really good food. A couple items from my order were missing, probably because they were super busy at the time. Overall, still a great spot to hang out and enjoy a meal. | we always have a great time here! the frozen marg pitcher is a must when coming with friends, and there are plenty of delicious options on the menu. i recommend looking for photos of what you want to order because some portions are very small, and others are very big! so that can cause a bit of confusion. overall, a great place!
Zambrero Pearse Street is a Mexican restaurant in Dublin. Customer reviews say: Surely one of the best burritos in town. Tried burrito bowl and I have to admit they have some really delicious stuff. Black rice, crunchy lettuce, great tasting sauces - I definitely loved the burrito here. To add to that the staff were friendly. So definitely a 5 star for what itGÇÖs worth and the category. | Pretty good burrito bowl (thereGÇÖs also a student discount =ƒñæ) Tbh the only reason I came was for their Plate4Plate mission (buy one plate they donate a plate to another person in need, I absolutely love this idea and more restaurants should have it) and sad to say but IGÇÖll only come back for this.  really great food but not sure if this is everyday but when I went the rice was sOo hardGÇª kinda ruined the bowl even though it was still overall pretty decent.  Idk IGÇÖll keep coming and hopefully IGÇÖll change my mind about the GÇ£just decentGÇ¥ food. | We got a burrito bowl and nachos. The food was very good. It was packed with fresh ingredients, and each bite was bursting with flavor.  However, the atmosphere left something to be desired. Despite the generally pleasant ambiance, our visit was disrupted by a group of teenage kids who were quite bothersome. They were annoying the workers and customers, including us, which significantly detracted from the dining experience. | Really nice burrito, nice friendly staff, quick service, fair price.  Only reason it wasn't 5-star was because it wasn't a Michelin star restaurant. Would happily make it my regular burrito place. | Today I went out for lunch with my friend and we were served by Alba! She was incredibly lovely and attentive with us, and IGÇÖll definitely be coming back!!  Everything is really delicious and at a great price!!
Pablo Picante is a Mexican restaurant in Dublin. Customer reviews say: Stopped in on a Sunday afternoon and ordered a Bean & Rice Burrito with a side of chips and salsa.  Tasted decent, but I wish we had some salt to add flavor - staff said they didn't have any.  Was decently priced, and service was fine. Probably wouldn't return again, but it did pretty much hit the spot a Mexican food craving we had. | Incredible vegan burritos here! Staff are really friendly and approachable. There's a few great vegan options, and with each burrito you get a choice of up to 6 levels of hot sauces. My burrito genuinely only took around 2 minutes to make, really fast! Packed with rice, beans, tofu and sauce - very tasty! | Amazing meals, service and cute place. Tried the Cali carnitas burrito and loved it. The prices are affordable too for the size of the portions. They offer discounts for students too which I think is great. | Bit mid to be honest.  For the price quantity and size of the burrito was alright, quality wise, bit tasteless but it was juicy so i guess it has that.  Super small, kinda quaint but when there's more than 3 people, bit annoying.  Lady at front seemed a bit not-so front of desk style and before payment even pops up, machine is asking for tips, yikes for me chief.  The lady behind who was cooking and preparing was nice though, i smile does go a long way unfortunately.  Wouldn't recommend really, maybe try another place nearby, but if you're hungry, go for it. | Probably the best burrito in the city centre. The quality and quantity are top notch. And they only include vegetables if you ask specifically which is great for me. However, they are slower than coastal erosion. There could be no queue and you'll still be wondering if they're delivering it from Mexico, but trust me, well worth the wait. This place mogs all other competitors in Dublin
La Gordita is a Mexican restaurant in Dublin. Customer reviews say: At the start they offered this shot ChefGÇÖs special and it was on the house, which was really nice, very tasty and delicious!  We ordered the: Achoas - it is tasty and whoever loves anchovies itGÇÖs a nice experience.  Tosta de atun - Tuna with a lot of vinagre taste and soaked, it was good but nothing special.  Tortilla Vaga - This is definitely 5 start food, very tasty and well made .  Filete a la pimenta - I found very grease and lack of seasoning and creativity on preparing this dish.  Patadas trufa - very grease too as well as the filete a la pimenta.  The overall food was ok, but the price charged doesnGÇÖt align with the food.  Obviously you pay for the place named Michelin 2025 and the environment which is very nice.  There is an option to order a rice as a side, I believe I shouldGÇÖve ordered that to feel satisfied with the amount of food (which is very pricy and very little and donGÇÖt expect anything special but the average ) | Wow what a find. Spanish style small plates with larger options for sharing.  Intimate setting, with some small tables and seats at the bar (where you can see into the kitchen), friendly staff knowledgeable about the menu, and absolutely killer margaritas.  We ordered the Bread with Garlic (should've got 2), Scallops wrapped in belly pork (chefs kiss), Tuna brioche toast (fold it and it eat like a taco) and the star of the show the Chuleton, sharing ribeye.  One of the highlights of our trip. | Beautiful restaurant.  Amazing staff.  The food was absolutely fantastic.  Fresh, flavorfulGÇªperfect way to start my trip in Dublin.  La gordita books fast, make your reservations early! Highly highly recommended!! | What a fab find off the beaten track! The food and vibe was brilliant. So tasty and would definitely recommend =ƒÿï | We went to La Gordita for a birthday dinner and it was very nice! The atmosphere inside feels like a warm hug, especially at the bar area. The food is tasty but it's pricey and portions are very very small. Definitely recommend ordering the paella and patatas bravas to feel full after the dinner. They said they suggest to order 4 plates per person which would be very pricey with the drinks. Overall a very good place for a nice occasion.
Chilangos IE is a Mexican restaurant in Dublin. Customer reviews say: The real Mexican flavors from Mexico City have made their way to Dublin. You really have to take the opportunity to try this amazing food. Approved by a Mexican! | Headed over to Chilangos last night after seeing the food on somebody's story the other week and we were blown away by the food, decor, service and the price. Portions were great, food was beautiful with real authentic flavors and presentation, and the margaritas were delicious. The place was nicely decorated giving it a real mexican vibe! Some of the friendliest staff you can imagine, with great recommendations and 10/10 service, so huge shoutout to Luca and Jamie for taking such good care of us. Really recommend the tacos, and the flan for dessert was to die for. We'll be back very soon for sure! | Genuine and exceptional Mexican street food. Making a reservation is a must; otherwise, it is very unlikely to get a table. Tacos are delicious, but what truly makes them unique in Dublin is something special: Gorditas and Pambasos. To highlight: Homemade salsas with the original Mexican street food flavour. To improve: Customer service. The waitress was quite rude at the checkout, even though we were on time for the following table. ItGÇÖs essential to maintain a composed demeanour and avoid revealing any stress to customers. Also, the heating. As far as I can see, it has been a problem since last winter (7 months). | We went on a Saturday before dia de los muertos and that place was poppin! Even though it was packed and we didnGÇÖt have a reservation, the hostess kindly found is a space. The food was amazing. We had a variety of quesadillas and they were super authentic. The salsa, so good. And we had some conchas that were just like the ones IGÇÖve had in Mexico. This place is a treasure. | For me, is the best Mexican food place. I'm a fan of the micheladas and tacos. And for dessert, a delicious vanilla concha.
Boojum - Smithfield is a Mexican restaurant in Dublin. Customer reviews say: Delicious Mexican GÇ£fast foodGÇ¥ restaurant. In comparison to places in England like BarBurrito and Tortilla, this place served larger quantities and tasted even fresher! The seasoning on the chicken was also much tastier that IGÇÖve had before.  Service was super quick and there was plenty of options ( burrito, burrito bowls, tacos , salads and nachos!) Price is on the higher side compared to what IGÇÖm use too but fair for the area. They do student discount too which is great. There is also a good array of soft drinks! | I recently visited with a few friends and it was my first time trying Boojum. I tried their burrito bowl. I got white rice, fajita veggies, carnitas, cheese, lettuce, and sour cream. The portion size was just right, and the fajita veggies were amazingGÇöIGÇÖm so glad I chose them over the beans!  The bowl was a bit plain and not very spicy at first, but adding the habanero sauce was a game-changer. It provided the perfect spicy kick that the dish needed.  The staff were friendly, and the atmosphere was nice, making it a pleasant experience overall. IGÇÖll definitely go back to Boojum from time to time! =ƒî»G£¿  Also they have student discount!!! | IGÇÖve been a customer at Bonjum for about a year and a half. The food is always tasty, well-prepared, and fairly priced. The atmosphere is pleasant, relaxing, and goes well with the meal.  The service also deserves mention, especially Emily, who always attends me with politeness, care, and respect. The whole team is helpful, which makes the experience even more comfortable.  ItGÇÖs a place where I always feel good having my meals. | loved it!!!!  ordered from JustEat and mentioned that this is my first time trying Boojum, not only did they give me a little gift of tortilla chips, they wrote a lovely note hoping I enjoy!! the burrito was absolutely fantastic and i completely understand the hype now, boojum is one of my top 3 places for food now!! | It was my first time visiting the place, so I needed some help to understand how everything worked. I really liked the atmosphere and the staff, especially Evelin, who was very patient in helping me choose and put together my meal. I highly recommend visiting and getting to know the place.
El Silencio is a Mexican restaurant in Dublin. Customer reviews say: 10/10 all round! Staff, food, cocktails & atmosphere were all fantastic. We were seated at the bar which I was a little apprehensive about while booking. But, when we arrived we were more than happy with our seating. You have a lot of space at the bar, and itGÇÖs almost like your own little section the way they have it organised. Highly recommend! | Such a lovely atmosphere and really nice staff. The veggie taco and nachos were unbelievable but the mushroom taco not great. Mango marg was the special and very tasty! Very good value for money | We had an amazing time, the Bar/Restaurant is disguised as a speakeasy and above a Burritoimbiss. I would recommend getting a reservation, as the space upstairs is quite small. If possible, definitely go on a Tuesday! Their taco-tuesday deal makes all tacoplates 6Gé¼, absolute steal :) | Great hidden Mexican restaurant with lovely cocktails. The menu is limited but what they offer is very good. Wonderful margaritas with friendly staff. Limited seating, booking is essential. Pairs sit at the bar, which would be vastly improved by having a footrest at the bar. Stools are quite tall so the footrest would make a worlds of difference. | Been here 2 times previously and had a great experience. Food & drinks are always amazing. One wait staff member tonight was very rude after I received the incorrect order. When explaining this was not what I had asked for or intended to have they persisted that this is what I ordered more than 2/3 times. I had to explain that this must have been a miscommunication but was met with more frustration and persistence about it being what I had asked for. It made the atmosphere at the table very uncomfortable. Disappointed with the experience and unsure if I would return after this. All other staff members who we dealt with were extremely kind and helpful.
Acapulco Mexican Restaurant is a Mexican restaurant in Dublin. Customer reviews say: Such a great and tasty food! Portions are enormous! We were stuffed after our meals. It was my boyfriend's birthday and they gave us a cherry brownie and sang happy birthday to him! He also had to wear a huge sombrero =ƒÿà=ƒÿü Everyone was so kind and smiling all the time. I appreciated the authentic music and the decor. The mango margarita was so delicious! We will be back again =ƒ½¦ | We booked for a large group of nine, and while our table was a bit of a squeeze, the lively atmosphere made up for the 'cosy' seating.  The menu is packed with tempting options, but my eyes were set on the legendary Chimichanga. We kicked things off with some spicy chicken wings and nachos. They were tasty and arrived quickly.  When the Chimichanga arrived, it was a true 'Man vs. Food' moment. This colossal dish, stuffed with chicken, cheese, pinto beans, jalape+¦os, and guacamole, was as delicious as it was huge. Not everyone at the table could conquer it, but the brave few who did earned some serious bragging rights. The cool, refreshing Margaritas were the perfect accompaniment to the challenge.  Just when we thought we couldn't manage another bite, we indulged in Acapulco's signature dessert: deep-fried ice cream with a homemade butterscotch sauce. It was a decadent and perfect end to the meal.  Overall, despite the snug table, Acapulco delivered a fantastic experience with food that impresses in both quantity and quality. | We had an amazing Mexican food experience at Acapulco. Stunning food (we ordered the fajitas and the burrito) and Margaritas were awesome too! Definitely recommend this place, book in advance if you want to be 100% sure you find a place to eat. | The food was good, tasty, and very filling. The interior was nicely colorful, the tables were quite close to eachother but it actually felt pretty authentic. The staff were friendly and the margarita was quite strong =ƒÿä | Me and my boyfriend came to grab some food while we were visiting Dublin from the UK. We quickly realised that even after new year the city is still very busy so without a booking it was looking unlikely for them to find us a table. The lovely host however said to us to wait a few minutes and heGÇÖd see what he could do. He managed to fit us in. Food was excellent and all servers were very friendly and attentive. PS. If you have a boyfriend that never seems to be full take him here, it will not disappoint!!
Tula Mexican Grill is a Mexican restaurant in Dublin. Customer reviews say: Fresh and tasty burritos and burrito bowls. Nice atmosphere, with good choice of music playing in the background. | I had the double meet, steak burrito=ƒî». Best one I've had so far! It was made quickly while also being perfectly rolled. Will certainly be back soon=ƒæì=ƒÅ+! | Delicious food! Came here for lunch and the atmosphere was really nice!!  Food and service were great. | Good food and great people | My favorite place for burritos in Dublin. Fresh food, the staffGÇÖs are very friendly and welcoming!
The Rialto Bridge Cafe is a Mexican restaurant in Dublin. Customer reviews say: Like a lot of the places I go too. Found this place by accident. Outside looked very inviting and busy inside. Which was a good sign. Had the vegetarian breakfast veggie sausage, tomatoes, beans, eggs and potato cake. Kids had American pancakes 2 very large fluffy pancakes served with fresh berries and syrup. Coffee blend used very flavorsome. Would definitely recommend this place and would go back. Service also 5 stars | I just moved to the area and this is the first time here. Quite surprised it was so busy in a Sunday but was able to get a table for 1.  Had the full Irish, ordered an extra portion of chips, an extra egg, extra pudding pot of tea and a glass or orange (freshly squeezed). As you can tell IGÇÖm a fat man leaving here today. Staff were friendly and background music was great.  Would definitely recommend and will return in future | This caf+¬ has a cozy vibe and friendly staff, which made for a pleasant experience overall. However, there was a small hiccup with my order. I ordered two American pancakes with maple syrup, and while the top pancake was perfectly fluffy and soaked in syrup, the bottom one was surprisingly dry. It felt like the syrup didnGÇÖt make it all the way down, which was a bit less tasty than expected.  That said, the atmosphere and service were great, and IGÇÖd still recommend giving this place a try. Maybe just ask for extra syrup if youGÇÖre ordering pancakes! =ƒ½¦=ƒÅ+ | Really loved the whole experience. I was there with a close friend and it was her first time to sit in, she normally gets takeaway coffee. The food was lovely and the staff were friendly and helpful, and the service was good overall. I'll definitely be back. | One of the best breakfast in Dublin!  Dulcet de leche pancakes were perfect! Reminded me of being back home in San Diego for Brunch!  The Mexicsm food was authentic, a rarity in Dublin.
Salsa - Authentic Mexican Food is a Mexican restaurant in Dublin. Customer reviews say: They were really nice and very helpful with choosing what to eat, the food was amazing and we ate a lot for a really good price, also the food was served fast. The place was cozy and the music =ƒæî.  I really recommend it if you want good Mexican food. We ate tacos dorados and torta de pastor, both amazing. (I also recommend mango and pineapple jarritos). We will go back for sure. | Stumbled in here after a Taco place I would normally go to was shut - we took a chance, and my goodness it was the right call!  Living in Dublin I find myself craving tacos... A LOT and as a vegetarian, its hard to find ones that hit the spot like those of icons such as birra, chorizo or barbacoa.  Salsa does not have that problem - a delicious blend of sweat potato, mushroom and red pepper, topped with salsa, dressed with fresh herbs and onion and wrapped in that beautiful little corn tortilla. A new go to has been found!  I have walked by the building 1000 times or more, but I shall no longer miss it - what a place and what a delicious lil taco spot to dine in or take out.  Massive congrats to the owner - T+í s+¬ delicious! | Food was alright. But I have had better tacos. I tried taco with chicken, Avacado, cheese, mushroom and peppar, salsa. Mango soda. Would be good to have shrimp as an option as well. | For me this restaurant in the only one that is not only true value for money,but the quality of food is spectacular. I order few times a month and have not been disappointed once. Thank you staff of Salsa for such a superb delicious and beautiful food =ƒÿï | Love it.  Really good, authentic tacos. Proper corn tortillas and even guava jarritos. Really fast and friendly service at a comfortable price point. Whether you eat in the cute dining room overlooked by Frida and serenaded by Selena or you take it home, you wonGÇÖt be disappointed.  If I hadnGÇÖt crushed those tacos so fast, there would be pictures.  Next time.
Priory Market is a Mexican restaurant in Dublin. Customer reviews say: Amazing food and 6 euro pints in Dublin!! Ya can't go wrong =ƒÿÄ=ƒì+ tried Park 27 and Flavouritos tonight.. both delicious =ƒÿï such a great place to have on our doorstep...  We have tried most places now and you just cant go wrong. My partner got the burger from The Fiery Pit =ƒæî and I had Park 27 again.. even Uncle Roger would approve =ƒæî=ƒ½í=ƒÿà FUIYOH! | This is a great place to visit if everyone in your group can't decide on what to eat. There is pizza, Italian, Korean, mexican, Thai, Vietnamese and sausage stall. They also have an ice-cream stall. There's a craft beer and wine section too.The food is of good quality and everyone of us enjoyed our meal. The music was a bit load for my liking but other than that I would highly recommend. | Excellent spot & nothing like it in Dublin despite food markets being so normal around Europe. It's in the suburbs so there's no tourists. Despite being busy on the weekend, there's still loads of seating available for big & small groups & lots of room for kids & babies. There are about a dozen different food options which are quite varied and delicious. There's a brewery & a coffee/wine bar. There is parking but sometimes it gets quite packed. | IGÇÖve been waiting for something like this in Tallaght and it didnGÇÖt disappoint. Food selection and quality is really good and reasonably priced. IGÇÖd had some of the vendors before in their previous establishments and the quality has been maintained. Big fan of Venezuelan food so I recommend Flavouritos, the Pabellion is delicious. In close second, MamaGÇÖs Boy for their Bahn Mi, the pork belly one is amazing. | Great indoor food market with a really nice atmosphere. Excellent variety of food options, plus their own craft beer brewed on site and a great cocktail selection. The vibe is fantastic! A brilliant spot to eat, drink and relax in Tallaght Village. Highly recommend!
Pickosito Northern Mexican Taqueria is a Mexican restaurant in Dublin. Customer reviews say: PickositoGÇÖs food never disappoints! You can taste itGÇÖs fresh and made with love. We always get the slow cooked beef taco with extra guacamole (although itGÇÖs very little guacamole for 2Gé¼), quesadillas and horchata.  The service is good, but the first time you come itGÇÖs a bit confusing. Meaning, you donGÇÖt really understand that you need to self serve, get your own menu then order at the counter. But with experience, you get there fast. A bit more emphasis on communicating this to new customers would help increase the overall experience.  The atmosphere is great if you want a place that is authentic. Seeing the chef work the dough, the pi+¦atas, fun facts displayed on posters adds to the Mexican feel.  I definitely recommend checking this place and coming back to try new things. | It was our first time at Pickasitos and we were genuinely impressed. The food was so fresh and full of flavour. Portions are big, but the prices feel really fair for what you get, so it ends up being great value.  The nachos were a standout. Plenty of guac (which we loved) and the cheese was spread throughout, not just dumped on the top few chips like you get in a lot of places. The tacos were packed with flavour, and the pulled beef burrito was really juicy.  We left super full and happy!! Would definitely recommend. | Portions are big. So 4 tacos is actually quite filling. The tortillas and guacamole are delicious!  Staff are very friendly..  Will come back again | I love Pickosito itGÇÖs DublinGÇÖs hidden gem. ItGÇÖs my go to spot for a quick dinner when IGÇÖm in Dublin. The quality of the food is unbelievable! Everything is always so fresh and full of flavour! The food is so filling and makes you feel content after. The staff are the nicest people ever they are always so helpful and so lovely. I could not recommend this restaurant enough to everyone itGÇÖs unbelievable! I would recommend the flour tortillas with the carne asada and also make sure you get some salsa verde itGÇÖs beautiful. | Spectacular. Authentic setting and food. I went for the chicken tacos on both corn and flour tortillas. Fantastically fresh and full of flavour. I wanted everything on the menu and will be back here on all future Dublin trips. 100% recommended.
El Grito Mexican Taqueria is a Mexican restaurant in Dublin. Customer reviews say: Great Tacos, very kind service from the girl in the front, lovely place, me and my husband  will come back soon Highly recommended | If you like real Mexican food, donGÇÖt order here. Food had no flavor, chicken was awful. I also ordered tacos and I received 4 tinyyyyy little soft shell tacos for ALMOST Gé¼13! Absolute robbery. DonGÇÖt understand why they would ever serve this garbage. Paid Gé¼27 for a burrito and 4 tiny tacos that could fit in one of my hands. | Nice place if you are in the mood for some good mexican food. Great for lunch, get the Maria sauce. Located in the food court, two floors up | Definitly a restaurant worse trying. The advise around the table were a bit mixed from "yeah good" to "omg incredible". Very good staff and pretty cool atmosphere. | Same delicious food as in original El Grito but faster service. Staff was very nice. Gave great suggestions!
GringoGÇÖs Cantina is a Mexican restaurant in Dublin. Customer reviews say: I just ordered a breakfast meal (ham and cheese quasadilla). It was very delicious, amount was also enough, the side salad was fresh and amazing, serving 5stars. It was a good start of the morning. Higly recommended, i have to go back to try the burritos also. Staff was very kind, and the big guy was very funny. Made my morning. :)) | Their food is fantastic. Personally itGÇÖs the best Mexican food I ever had =ƒÑ¦=ƒÑ¦GÖÑn+ÅGÖÑn+Å | From California, US and this is truly good Mexican food! The spicy salsa is a nice medium spice level with tons of flavor and the burrito was delicious! Service was friendly and warm! | Seen this place on Deliveroo and it had some good reviews, decided to try give it a go and was severely disappointed. Got a burrito bowl that lacked flavour and looked unappetising. Beginning to question the authenticity of the other reviews. | I highly recommend this place! Great food great atmosphere! Best price quality place you find around.
Boojum - Mespil Road is a Mexican restaurant in Dublin. Customer reviews say: Nice restaurant and affordable food. As it is near my office i visit here for lunch =ƒÿï. Their burritos =ƒî» and bowls =ƒÑú are good. They also have beverages but as per normal price there is no meal deal. | I usually have a great experience at this BoojumGÇöthe food is always excellent, and the staff are generally friendly. However, on 13 March 2025 at 18:04, I had a disappointing experience.  I was ordering for a friend, but there was a miscommunication about whether they wanted a bowl or a burrito. I paid for the bowl but realized the mistake after leaving. When I returned to request a swap to a burrito, the staff said it would cost Gé¼0.85, claiming the bowl contained more food.  I briefly left but returned within two minutes to clarify. A staff member initially said there would be no extra charge if the remaining food stayed in the store. We agreed, and they transferred the food to a wrap. However, after doing so, they suddenly insisted I had to pay the Gé¼0.85. When I questioned this, the staff member became aggressive, raising her voice and refusing to listen. Her attitude was unprofessional and unnecessarily rude.  Another employee stepped in, took ownership of the situation, and confirmed I didnGÇÖt need to pay. I later called another Boojum location, and they said pricing policies vary by store, but swapping from a burrito to a bowl typically incurs no extra charge.  This experience was disappointing. While it may have been a one-off, the staff member could have been more polite in their style of communication. | Food was great as usual I own two boojum tshirts which shows my loyalty as a customer. I went in about half an hour before closing and staff were extremely unwelcoming. The staff member serving me was cold and me feel unwelcome and uncomfortable. | Boojum on Mespil Road is a solid choice when youGÇÖre looking for a quick, tasty and satisfying meal. The food is fresh, flavourful, and always hits the spot GÇö whether you go for a burrito, a bowl or tacos. ItGÇÖs consistent, generous with portions, and great value for what you get.  The staff are friendly and efficient, making the experience smooth even during busy hours. Service tends to be quick, and despite the fast-casual vibe, thereGÇÖs a welcoming atmosphere that makes you feel looked after.  Overall, itGÇÖs a reliable spot in a handy location GÇö perfect for a lunch break or a casual dinner when you want something filling and full of flavour. | Used to eat here every week when I was renting around the area, and Boojum on Mespil Road never let me down. Proper handy spot for a quick, filling feed. Burritos and bowls are always fresh, packed well, and full of flavour...Great value for the money.  Service is usually quick even when itGÇÖs busy, and the place has a good buzz without feeling rushed. ItGÇÖs one of those spots you can rely on, whether itGÇÖs lunch or a casual dinner.
Kalabasa Market is a Mexican restaurant in Dublin. Customer reviews say: I was looking forward to dining at Kalabasa Market, but my experience left quite a bit to be desired. It felt like seating was reserved for those who personally knew the staffGÇöwalk-ins like us were left waiting while others were quickly accommodated. Once we were finally seated, the table was still covered in crumbs and spills from previous guests. Even after 20 minutes, no one came to clean it, despite us asking three times. Service was frustratingly slow, and as a non-Spanish speaker, I felt somewhat dismissed rather than welcomed. ItGÇÖs a shame, because the place has potential. I hope they consider improving accessibility, hospitality, and basic service for all guests. | G++  I had a great experience at this Latin pub! The atmosphere was vibrant and welcoming, and the service was excellent. Louis was an amazing waiter GÇô very attentive, friendly, and made sure we had everything we needed. He truly made the evening even better. Highly recommend this place! | To start with the positive, the staff were really friendly.  Unfortunately, for me, it was a rip-off. My burger was cold and it came with a pile of lettuce and a few pieces of chopped tomato as an excuse for a salad. No dressing or anything. In the photo, youGÇÖll see there are some beans that my mate gave me in sympathy.  The waiter offered to replace it straight away, so no complaints about the wait staff.  The burger itself was straight out of the freezer. It cost 14Gé¼, which is outrageous. WonGÇÖt be returning. | We had a lovely first visit to your restaurant. The vibe was great, and the staff were very attentive. As it was my first time trying the dish I ordered, I don't feel I can fairly comment on the food itself.  The only thing that gave me pause was the 10% mandatory service charge for group of four or more.I personally prefer the freedom to leave a tip based on the service experience. This policy was the main reason for my 3-star rating on this occasion. Perhaps it's just my lack of familiarity with this practice. | During my holidays in Dublin I went to that pub and it was amazing. The atmosphere and the service were exceptional. Our waitress was Elizabeth, and she was incredibly kind and helpful with us.
Tacos Lupillo "The Saint" (Mexican Street Food) is a Mexican restaurant in Dublin. Customer reviews say: I stopped by the new Tacos Lupillo to try their shrimp Gobernador tacos, and they were so good! The shrimp was fresh, the cheese perfectly melted, - itGÇÖs clear they put a lot of love into their food. Definitely worth a visit, and I canGÇÖt wait to go back and try more! | The place looks great and has a convenient setup, as itGÇÖs combined with the pub, making it easy to enjoy food and drinks at the same time.  That said, the food was underwhelming. The "al pastor sirloin" didnGÇÖt meet expectations and was noticeably inferior to the al pastor served at the other Lupillo location. Additionally, traditional Mexican drinks like horchata or champurrado were unavailable during my visit, which was disappointing.  As for the service, the cashier made a mistake with my order, selecting the wrong type of meat and charging me extra. When I pointed it out, he refunded the 2Gé¼, but his attitude was dismissive, which left a bad impression.  Cochinita pibil can be found as tasteless. It is the big piece you can find in the photo attached to my review | The Lupillo Bag in Dublin is a hidden gem for Mexican food lovers! The flavors are absolutely delicious, offering an authentic and unforgettable taste experience. A perfect spot for anyone looking for quality take away. Highly recommended! | I have been to the other location and we had great service and food but this location is an actual joke. I never write bad reviews but we waited an hour for the food which is supposedly GÇ£fast foodGÇ¥. When we went up to tell them that it had been an hour since we ordered (we ordered 10 tacos), they told us that they already made the order and they threw it out. Our buzzer did not go off whatsoever. Someone was at the table with the buzzer on it at all times. It is a Tuesday and they definitely need a better system for things because I have seen past reviews of people waiting an hour for 5 tacos. My partner mentioned that it must have been broken and the person behind the counter was rude and told him it wasnGÇÖt but it didnGÇÖt buzz. I am not coming back here and I do not recommend it if you are hungry and looking for fast service. They also say on their menu that the tacos come with onion and coriander, ours didnGÇÖt and it came out sloppy. | Amazing! The place is inside the pub, no reservation needed. The food is absolutely delicious and the customer service is outstanding. 100000/10
Zambrero Dundrum is a Mexican restaurant in Dublin. Customer reviews say: "Had an amazing meal at Zambrero GÇö the food was fresh and full of flavour! Big thanks to Supipi for the great service and making it such a good feed. Really appreciated the friendly vibe!" | Excellent experience at Zambrero. The food was delicious and fresh, and SupipiGÇÖs outstanding service made it even better. G¥ñn+ÅHighly recommend!=ƒñ¬=ƒñ¬=ƒñ¬=ƒñ¬ | Portions have become a bit stingy see the teaspoon of sour cream and even smaller amount of beans, cheese and sauce. Copious amounts of lettuce to make up the volume of the bowl. The meat portion is actually good. I'm not looking for a bigger bowl just better ratios. This is not unique to this location. Staff are nice and service is good. | I LOVE zambrero. Good portion, good food and good price. My favourite staff in dundrum is Supipi. She's always very nice and efficient. | I really enjoy the food in Zambrero!!! Many thanks to Robyn, Supipi and Matilda. TheyGÇÖre very nice and kind=ƒæì The food here is in big portion and I definitely recommend it to everyone!!!
El Milagro Mexican food is a Mexican restaurant in Dublin. Customer reviews say: Great tacos and burritos - the beef Birria  was so nice and juicy - had some tortilla chips too and some Mexican fizzy juice too | Very fresh and nice tacos. The chicken seemed under seasoned though, like it was missing something. Guava drink is very nice. I did think it's fairly expensive though, 22 euro for 2 tacos, some nachos and a drink. | Ordered taco's, which were extremely bland and overpriced, 14 for two tacos with toppings costing extra. The staff were lovely though but the food that I ordered wasnt worth the price |  | Got delivery, lovely delivery man. Food was nice, my only gripe was 2 euro each to add hot sauce and sour creme. They come in tubs outside the burrito. A burrito is a sealed unit, the sauces should be in the burrito, and should NOT cost 2 euro per 15ml quantitiy
Boojum - Hanover Quay is a Mexican restaurant in Dublin. Customer reviews say: Great and cool staff! Delicious and hearty food.  Got 4 tasty portions via TooGoodToGo.  Thank you very much! | Great Mexican food. Ordered burritos bowl and beef chili Amazing taste, quick service , indoor and outdoor seating both. It's very busy during weekdays for lunch as well as dinner. Fast and quick and healthy options | I order something vegetarian they served me MEAT in it. Literally read meat. Bowl was super small and they forgot my coca cola. I requested refund and never order anything from this place again. | First time in the trending Mexican burrito establishment in Dublin for my wife and I on early Sunday afternoon. Any confusion was aided instantly with help from a very efficient young man! He explained the menu very well and talked us through the process with zero gaps in his knowledge. The experience was an overall a pleasant one with no issues with comfort or atmosphere as we enjoyed our burritos while the rain passed. Would recommend to anyone. | I ordered food from here by Deliveroo and the driver kept cancelling and when I rang the restaurant the team was so so helpful! They were really kind and even asked me to ring back to let them know what Deliveroo had said so they could help! Honestly 10/10 service!
Zambrero is a Mexican restaurant in Dublin. Customer reviews say: I called to your place in Dundrum a few weeks back with my mom. I queued for 15minutes, in which I was happy to queue because I was happy to try it out especially with the hype about it. I spotted one of your employees emptying the bag of chopped lettuce, which is chopped already- into one of the containers, she had gloves on.. then she proceeded to fill a wrap with the same gloves and then she handled money with the same gloves, I was disgusted watching this and she continued on filling another salad box with the same gloves..........where is the hygiene???? we walked away with another customer and never got to try your salad. I do think you should be properly train your staff on hygiene and also all lettuce or salad should be washed coming out of a bag!!!!!!!!!! | This is an amazing place to eat if you want to something healthy and enough food to fill you stomach. They have tons of options and also you can create your own salad or wrap. I tried love me tenderGÇ¥ and the mixes of the flavors were amazing | Great range of fresh salads and healthy options. Quite inexpensive,  though I would say 1 salad is probably enough for 2 ? The portion size is very generous indeed. Generally the queue is quite quickly served Staff are very welcoming and pleased to explain queries | Service was good. Ordered the classic burrito, one of the worst burritos that I ever had in my life, the beef was half cold half warm, no flavour. Staff were great, helpful, food needs to be improved and not worth the price. | Quite stingy portions, but the food is lovely quality. The staff are usually friendly and the service is fast enough if the queues arenGÇÖt too big.
Zambrero Cherrywood is a Mexican restaurant in Dublin. Customer reviews say: This used to be my go-to lunch place, but lately it has been very disappointing. The manager and the staff has been very stingy with the portion size. A regular bowl used to be so filling and it still is, in other branches. Here even after asking for more, theyGÇÖre very stingy and the manager kept eyeing the staff who was preparing my bowl. This time around it was extremely disappointing, the jalape+¦os pieces are huge and I found a random piece of plastic in my bowl. I hope they fix these issues, since I love Zambrero | Worst restaurant in Ireland. Ordered a Vegan friendly burrito. They have sent one with cheese in it (photo attached), when the order clearly mentioned No Cheese. When called, they say they have no idea. Store manager is not available. And they claim, "they'll try to make things better". On top of that, it was a regular burrito, but they managed to sent a small one (and this is not the first time this has happened).. | Classic Vegetarian,Half / Half,Double Pinto Beans,No Cos Lettuce,Add Lime Juice,Add Crushed Corn Chips,Add Jalape+¦os,Garlic Sauce,No Drinks I ordered veg bowl with double pinto beans however there were no beans in the bowl this is really ridiculous. There is no place to raise issue about the order | If I was able to give this 0 stars I would. I paid Gé¼11.30 for this bowl (see below) that wasnGÇÖt even half full when mixed together. Manager Maria is woeful with the portions given to paying customers. All the reviews say they will improve with this issue but every time I give this place a chance nothing changes, as if it comes from her pockets herself. If she was GÇ£working to improveGÇ¥ as she says in every comment maybe more customers will come back rather than leave still feeling hungry. | Amazing Mexican fast food that tastes gorgeous and fresh, at a fraction of the wait and price youGÇÖd get elsewhere. The staff are always lovely and are very efficient too, despite how busy it can get with in-store customers and takeaway orders. The quesadillas and toasted burritos are the stars of the menu! I love this place.
Brassa is a Mexican restaurant in Dublin. Customer reviews say: ThatGÇÖs was definitely an amanzing experience , exceeded my expectations thanks to the delicious food and excellent treatment. I truly recommend , the best in Ireland | I tried the taco, highly recommended. The service was a 10/10 and the staff are very friendly | the food quality was excellent and i love de service overall a place i will return to | one of the best burritos iGÇÖve tried, great food and very friendly service :) | It's a nice place, the food is delicious and very Mexican in flavor, the service is good, and you can enjoy the very Mexican atmosphere, I recommend it.
Masa Drury St is a Mexican restaurant in Dublin. Customer reviews say: Nice place to get some different Mexican food. The guacamole felt really natural with a nice lime aftertaste that was very refreshing. The quesadilla is okay, but the tacos are fantastic, many flavors and textures mixed together but the meat is still the main ingredient in every bite, we really enjoyed them. The staff was very nice, and the service pretty fast, and although we stayed in the window, it didnGÇÖt feel very uncomfortable. | Really enjoyed this place! We walked in for an early dinner, maybe 5:15, and were seated immediately. The chips and guacamole was very tasty, though itGÇÖs a small portion, and the traditional margaritas were also nice. The tacos were quite good, we especially liked the steak, and all the food came out quickly. As Americans, weGÇÖre always skeptical about tacos on this side of the Atlantic, but we were satisfied. | I had a great experience with both the floor and kitchen staff. I was seated right in front of the kitchen, and everything was impressively well-organized. I got my order in less than 10 minutes. | I went with my family after seeing a good few people enjoying their meals, which tempted us to give it a try. We waited around 10 minutes for a table. The staff were lovely and very attentive. The food, however, wasnGÇÖt really our thing. There were quite a lot of spices, especially paprika, more than weGÇÖre used to in other Mexican restaurants. That said, the ingredients were fresh, particularly the guacamole. The tacos werenGÇÖt to our taste, so we couldnGÇÖt finish them. The quesadilla filling was nice, but again the paprika was a bit strong for us. They have a great selection of drinks. It might suit others more than us, but fair play to them and best of luck. | Masa was a very pleasant surprise!  We tried it many years before and left being not particularly impressed.  This time instead our food was very tasty and the margarita strong and delicious.  The place was buzzing and that contributed to a great night with some new friends.
Salsa - Authentic Mexican Food is a Mexican restaurant in Dublin. Customer reviews say: You will never go wrong dining here! Aside from the great food, all their staffs are really friendly. They have tables where you can eat outside or you can go to the upper floor. Also would like to mention that price is pretty good. Ive only tried their tacos and I keep coming back for it but definitely will also try the rest like their quesadillas, burritos and bowls :) | If you want to taste one of the best tacos in town visiting Salsa its a must, the service was quick, staff is super friendly and taste was incredible, will be visiting again for sure | Every time I visit Salsa, it feels like a piece of Mexico in Dublin! The food is always delicious, fresh, and full of flavour. The team is super friendly and welcoming GÇö you can feel the love they put into every dish. If youGÇÖre looking for real, authentic Mexican food, Salsa is the place to go. Highly recommend it! | Best Mexican food in Dublin! Love itt | Almost feel like IGÇÖm in Mexico here!! The food is so good and even more amazing for Ireland! Be ware of the salsas- they ARE spicy =ƒî¦n+Å!! The horchata is so good as well! Enjoy
Zambrero Hatch Street is a Mexican restaurant in Dublin. Customer reviews say: Visit the place mid week at 12.00 after training for post-workout meal. Decided for a powerbowl which came as a decent portion. The negative thing might only be the fact that at the momment I came the food did not look so fresh, but the taste and expectations were satisfied after the order. Overall: - Good food and decent portion - Price (9,50Gé¼ for beef & chicken powerbowl) is not the cheapest - Ambient looks really nice to sit down a have a lunch - They have a student deal of Burito/Bowl plus free drink (which I saw too late) | Zambrero offers one of the best Mexican fast food in Dublin. Great for everyone! Also great coffee! | Taste is good, but it is extremely pricy.  The bowl as you can see in the photo is way smaller than any of the bowls of other competitors in Dublin, and the price is the same/higher.  Today I got a superbowl for a bit of extra meat and guess what? Cheese wasnGÇÖt included in that higher price, even though it is included with no cost in the normal bowl (cheaper version). So for the already small bowl with a bit of extra meat +cheese + guacamole I paid 14 euro!!! Sorry but this is extremely expensive for what you get.  Another tip to the management team. Use bigger bowls also so that people can mix the different ingredients together, because now this is impossible to do that without spilling everything out of the bowl. | Very decent breakfast.  Pretty good egg pot and breakfast burrito. | I go to this place often since last couple of years. Love their classic burrito with black rice and pinto beans. Staff is quite friendly and nice. Highly recommend!
Boojum - Kevin Street is a Mexican restaurant in Dublin. Customer reviews say: Great place to get a quick bite and some nice smiles from the staff :)  Vegan and vegetarian options available including vegan sour cream.  I got a burrito with veggies, chilli beans and plant based al pastor. The mock pork is quite interesting (made of mushroom?) and gives the burrito a little bit of crunchiness. | Really good food and filling. My burrito bowl was so generous in portion that it could easily feed two people, which is just great for the money! | BOOjum exactly how I just wrote it!!! Absolute ROBBERY Gé¼20.47 as dry as a sandpapered hole out in the Sahara Desert!! NOT A DROPLET OF SOURCREAM, CHEESE OR SALSAGÇª.ABSOLUTE DISGRACEFUL  CouldnGÇÖt even call this Mexican food  ItGÇÖs on the receipt but not on the burrito  LET THIS BE THE SIGN NOT TO ORDER FROM AN BOOJUM CHAIN EVER!  NO EXCUSES FOR THIS | The foodGÇÖs really good and not that pricey, portions are just right. Staff are super friendly, and you can take your time picking what you want GÇô if youGÇÖre unsure, just ask. Inside thereGÇÖs usually enough space to chill, plus theyGÇÖve got some free sauces you can grab. All in all, a solid spot GÇô perfect if youGÇÖre nearby and want something quick but tasty. | Honestly my biggest gripe was with the size of the burrito, it was rather small. Also, quite bland ? I am used to burritos having a variety of flavors, while here I could mostly taste just the sauce. Weak flavor of rice, beans, meat etc.
Boojum - Abbey Street is a Mexican restaurant in Dublin. Customer reviews say: This just reminded me about how awesome Chipotle used to be, and made me sad. Burritos were loaded so much that they had a hard time wrapping it. Flavors decent, but I'm not going here for a gourmet meal. I'm going for a giant burrito, and that's exactly what I got. | I love eating here, but you have to be lucky when you come, because sometimes they put a lot of meat and sometimes almost nothing (it depends on who is serving, there is a girl who doesn't put anything), forcing you to ask for extra, today was an example, they put almost no meat | Do not order from here! I received a delivery from this restaurant and my burrito had wood inside and what looked like animal droppings! I didnGÇÖt realise this was in my food until too late. I love boojum usually love boojum but stay away from this branch. | Boojum - Abbey Street: Dublin's Ultimate Burrito Fix! =ƒç+=ƒç¬=ƒ½éGÿÿn+Å  If youGÇÖre craving a huge, satisfying, and flavour-packed Mexican feed in Dublin, Boojum on Abbey Street is essentially a local institution. It's the king of fast-casual Mexican food, giving you massive portions that are fantastic value for money. =ƒî»=ƒææ  The setup is classic assembly-line style, but the ingredients are far from standard fast food. Everything is made *fresh* dailyGÇöfrom the slow-cooked meats (the carnitas and chipotle chicken are customer favourites!) to the vibrant, punchy salsas. They even offer a terrifying-sounding but beloved **Naga salsa** for the truly brave. =ƒöÑ=ƒî¦n+Å  The Highlights (The Feast):  * Size Matters: The burritos here are legendary. They are giant, tightly wrapped cylinders of Mexican rice, meat, beans, and fillings. You'll likely need to use a fork by the time you're halfway through, and you definitely won't be hungry afterwards. =ƒÆÜ * Customization Heaven: You are the master chef here. You choose everything: burrito, bowl, or tacos; black or pinto beans; all the fresh toppings and salsas. This makes it a great spot for vegans and vegetarians too, with options like Vegan Chilli Beans and Pork Imitator fillings. =ƒÑæ=ƒÑª * The Vibe: ItGÇÖs centrally located right near O'Connell Street, so it's always buzzing with shoppers, students (hello, student discount!), and office workers. ItGÇÖs loud, quick, and efficientGÇöperfect for a satisfying lunch or a post-pub dinner.  While the service style is fast and occasional reports mention minor mix-ups (especially with delivery), the quality and sheer volume of the food keep people lining up. ItGÇÖs a reliable, delicious, and budget-friendly win! =ƒÖÅ=ƒÅ+=ƒò»G£¥n+Å=ƒç+=ƒçª=ƒòè  5/5 Stars! G¡ÉG¡ÉG¡ÉG¡É | I needed a quick lunch between calls, and popped into the Abbey Street Boojum. I went for the vegan pork, beans, spicy rice, sweet corn and guacamole, with three different salsas, and had a well stacked tub to munch into. The staff were so friendly and helpful, and I especially want to highlight this. (Tuesday team, thanks!). For 12 Euro, you can't go wrong.
Smash It is a Mexican restaurant in Dublin. Customer reviews say: Very disappointed. The 10GÇ¥ hotdog on the menu is 6GÇ¥ at most, and is very skinny too. The chocolate milkshake (Gé¼6) did not even taste like it was made from chocolate ice-cream, it tasted more like just chocolate sauce in milk(which it probably was as you could clearly see chocolate sauce on the top of the milkshake when it arrived). So a very, very disappointing hotdog (size and taste wise), and a horrible chocolate milkshake for me. The Mexican wave burger and the kids burger was pretty nice to be honest. The girl at the door was friendly but the serving staff seemed very new and inexperienced. We definitely will not be back and would not recommend in any way. | had Smash Burger in Dundrum and honestly, it was the best food IGÇÖve ever had in Dublin. The burgers were unreal GÇö so fresh, perfectly cooked, and full of flavour. The staff were incredibly fun and welcoming, which made the whole experience even better. The service was fast, friendly, and genuinely impressive.  IGÇÖll definitely be back soon. Highly recommend | Really enjoyed this place. Food was perfect, staff were very friendly. The burgers are excellent. | It was a really nice place. I loved how the workers was like when they took my order. I loved the food, but the problem was the burger. You see, the burger was a bit too big and heavy. Overall, it's nice, I liked the fries and Ice cream. It was good. | The people there are very nice. Good food and service
Fire & Stone Eatery is a Mexican restaurant in Dublin. Customer reviews say: Great good again! We ended up ordering the same menu as last time Frank Eggs Benedict and Briscof French toast.. enjoyed it full time.. getting a table is really a challenge as have to wait in queue for almost 20/30 mins.. GÇöGÇöGÇöGÇöGÇöGÇöGÇöGÇöGÇöGÇöGÇöGÇöGÇöGÇöGÇöGÇöGÇöGÇöGÇöGÇö- Old review :- Great food, had to wait to get a table as it was quite busy.. my little one also enjoyed chit chatting with people around.. Highly recommended! | G¡ÉG¡ÉG¡ÉG¡ÉG¡É Perfect spot for Breakfast & Lunch!  Delicious food, great location, and a cozy atmosphere. The staff are very friendly and welcoming, and the place is spotless. Ideal for a relaxed meal, whether solo or with friends. Highly recommend!! | We went here for brunch and tried there French Toast and Frank's Chicken Eggs Benedict. Food was good. Matcha was also good. French Toast was very good and lovely flavours because of Pistachio. Few improvements I would suggest is that the Bread on French Toast could have been a bit crispy and Benedict was bit too salty for my taste. They have indoor and outdoor sitting and there is good amount of parking. | Went there alone during the rush hour. The place is really cool, good vibe. It was packed had to wait for a few minutes, but it was worth it. The food was delicious and fulfilling. Coffee was 10/10, and the service was really nice and polite! Definitely will come back! | Really nice spot with a relaxed atmosphere and friendly service. The food was fresh, well cooked and nicely presented, with generous portion sizes. Everything we had was enjoyable and satisfying, though it didnGÇÖt quite have that standout GÇ£wowGÇ¥ element that would make it a regular go-to for us. That said, it was a very pleasant experience overall and weGÇÖd happily recommend it for a good brunch spot
Pablo Picante is a Mexican restaurant in Dublin. Customer reviews say: Great place for a Mexican street food. The trash can nachos are huge and they come with a great mix of sauces that last until the very end, really good value for the money. Burritos come fully loaded, the barbecue one is okay but I think it needs something fresh, as it feels a little heavy at the end. The healthy hombre achieves this with the feta cheese, really nice combination this one. | This is a very expensive but tasty Mexican. A small nachos is Gé¼10.50 but we enjoyed it really well. Ordering was a bit confusing and you have to collect the food yourself which is a bit of an inconvenience | The beef burrito was good lots of flavor. I also had the chips and queso they were good. The chicken burrito lacked a bit of flavor the chicken was kind of dry. | First time here today and safe to say it wonGÇÖt be the last. Fresh ingredients, unreal burritos, and flavours that hit straight away. Simple, filling, and done properly.  Dublin classic for a reason. | Don't let the interior put you off. It's basic but the food is delicious. I would recommend the El Classico burrito with steak, which was good quality. The margarita is good as well
Zambrero is a Mexican restaurant in Dublin. Customer reviews say: Best place iGÇÖve ever gone to, the food is absolutely amazing and the customer service is terrific, especially with Krissia, she is very helpful and friendly and i really enjoyed my time here :) | Its taste was better than any other mexican chains in Ireland. But the matter is their bad customer service, so I get it why the rate is not high enough over 4 stars. It was pretty aggressive service for me, so I thought it might have been trainee but made me surprised that was supervisorGÇÖs service. | Came in with high expectations and left very disappointed.  First off, the portion sizes. Keep in mind I came in the morning, so it's not busy and everything is fully stocked and ready.  I'm not joking when I say I got an actual teaspoon worth of pinto beans and maybe 2 tablespoons of rice on my burrito. I was immediately wondering where on earth the rest of my burrito was.  Next came the meat. Reasonably sized scoop of pork, but given how little rice and beans I got, I asked if I could get a little bit more pulled pork, to which I was told very bluntly I have to pay for that.  At least they were generous with the vegetables, but the very limited selection kind of threw me off - normally any burrito place I go to have twice the amount of options.  Then, the burrito itself. It really wasn't great. The rice and beans were essentially imperceptible, the pork was drenched in a horrendously sweet and artificial-tasting barbaque sauce (yet somehow the meat was still dry), and the overwhelming majority of the wrap was vegetables. Now granted, I got all the veg options on it (of which there are about 4) but ONLY because of how little rice and beans I was given.  The vegetables, like the pork, were also all horrifically sweet. I seriously think they must coat them with sugar.  The wrap was only very lightly warmed, so by the time I sat down and took a bite of the burrito, it was lukewarm at best.  To add to the underwhelming experience, my girlfriend's order of loaded nachos was a similar ordeal. Very light on all the ingredients, even the nachos themselves!  She had been to other Zambreros and gotten the same thing before, and said she had never had a plate that bare.  To top it all off, the issues with the staff. The lady who served us (one of the two there, although one was just on his laptop in the eating area) kept staring over at myself and my girlfriend and hiding when we looked over. She was also coughing all over the work area in the back without covering her mouth, and I assume that's the area where the food is prepared, making it even more disgusting and unhygienic.  Very disappointed with this place. I was expecting good things since it's located in such a affluent area. Real shame, since this has now put me off from visiting any other Zambreros in the future. | Food was really good, especially the beef. Customer service was quick and easy, no issues at all, would recommend. | I had such a fantastic experience at Zambrero! The food was fresh, flavorful, and full of that vibrant energy you expect from great Mexican-inspired cuisine. Every bite felt wholesome yet indulgent, and the menu offered plenty of options to suit different tastes.  What truly made the visit memorable, though, was the outstanding service from Elton. He was welcoming, attentive, and genuinely enthusiastic about making sure everything was perfect. His friendly attitude and professionalism added so much warmth to the atmosphere, it felt less like a transaction and more like being looked after by someone who really cares.  Zambrero already stands out for its delicious food and social mission, but with team members like Elton, the experience goes above and beyond. Highly recommend both the restaurant and the incredible service!
Chopped Sandyford is a Mexican restaurant in Dublin. Customer reviews say: Gé¼9 for a wrap??? Chicken, Bacon and the skimpiest bit of lettuce. Staff were meh, not really interested.  Not even a nice tasty wrap. . Learned a valuable lesson. Chopped them from MY lunch menu! | Tiny portion, and no traces of chicken that I ordered. Avoid, there are other way better salad options in the area! | Love chopped but the menu has changed dramatically and not good value, 12.90e for a chicken wrap, won't be caught/back again. | I ordered my lunch online through Just eat. I ordered a mexican bowel. I was looking forward until it came with the bowel opened all over the bag. I would suggest that you use tape instead.  I used to order from hear regularly but never again unless its in person.  Very disappointing. | A+ºai tastes bad , frozen like a rock n fruits as strawberries are frozen. The lady wanted to offer me a frozen cup of pineapple n a+ºai seems made for some 1 earlier. The pineapple tasted as if it was cut on board used for cutting chicken. Not recommended at all.
Zambrero Grangegorman is a Mexican restaurant in Dublin. Customer reviews say: Staff always deliver great service, food is always delivered quickly and the staff are great. Always my go to spot when it comes to getting Lunch. Was given great service by staff members Eduarda and Luis on several occasions definitely would recommend. | Always a great spot for lunch, the staff are always incredibly friendly and helpful, the food is delicious, the interior is lovely and comfortable. The price is very good for the portion size that you get. Highly recommend Gÿ¦n+Å | Love this branch. I always come here for lunch because it's the best food in the area and I always get it quickly. Eduarda and Luis stand out especially, so friendly and they do a great job! Really recommend to anyone needing a healthy lunch. | Dropped in here after someone recommended it to me. Staff were very friendly,the place is clean and bright, the burrito was fantastic bursting with flavour and a generous portion, one of the best I've had. They except cash too unlike some other establishment. This will be my go-to place for a Mexican in the future. Opens late too which is great! | Excellent and friendly service as always from Juanita and Wilbert. ItGÇÖs always a pleasure to go to Zambrero because of the lovely staff. Many thanks
Mama's Revenge is a Mexican restaurant in Dublin. Customer reviews say: We got take away to bring to a picnic on merrion square and I forgot to take pictures of the food. The portions are huge and the nachos and tacos are pretty decent. ItGÇÖs good value for money. I would come back to try the burrito. | My favorite place in Dublin for a delicious yet healthy and affordable meal. The team are all lovely here too.  Easily the best Mexican burrito in Dublin in my opinion. | I ordered the tacos with different fillings. The tortilla is so niceee they toasted and become so crunchy. I like they give some tortilla chips to the side. The staff is lovely. Definitely mi lugar favorito de comida mexicana =ƒ½¦=ƒÅ+ | Nice staff, presentation and menu but not much flavor. I had a pulled pork burrito. Good serving and reasonable price. The bad part was it was quite bland and unseasoned. I added the GÇ£mango habanero spicyGÇ¥ salsa but it was not spicy at all, or fruity for that matter. Tasted like sad tomato. If you advertise a salsa as spicy and have many salsa options it would be nice for it to be accurate. Also add some more season to the meat. | Mexican food in Dublin? Yes, and it's good! You can't miss with any of the quesadillas. I'd recommend getting sour cream or salsa to dip them.
Suertudo is a Mexican restaurant in Dublin. Customer reviews say: I was lucky enough to visit Suertudo in Dublin, and it was an incredible experience. The atmosphere is cozy and stylish, perfect for a relaxed meal or a special occasion. The food has a delicious Mexican touch that makes it unique and comforting, full of flavor and creativity. You can really see the care in every dish. The service was exceptional, especially thanks to the manager, who made everything even more special. Without a doubt, itGÇÖs a place IGÇÖd love to return to and wholeheartedly recommend! | My partner and I had a delicious evening meal there off their Taco Tuesday menu. Everything was very tasty and the staff was very chatty. Spicy marg was delish. Only thing I could say, is that the atmosphere was a little dead as it was early evening! 9/10 would recommend to a friend and would return. | Hands down the best Mexican fusion spot IGÇÖve been to in Dublin. The service was absolutely stunning, and the food was on another level GÇö every bite felt like a perfect mix of creativity and authenticity.  The atmosphere is spot on too: the soft, half-light gives it a romantic feel, making it an ideal place for a date night or simply to try something different from your usual spots. The music was perfectly chosen and at just the right volume GÇö enough to set the mood without making you raise your voice, so you can enjoy your own conversation without overhearing everyone elseGÇÖs.  And a big plus: itGÇÖs dog-friendly, which makes it such a refreshing and inclusive option in the city.  Highly recommend! | Suertudo is a cozy and welcoming spot with outstanding Oaxacan-style Mexican food. The dishes are top quality and full of authentic flavor. The service is excellent, and the cocktails are unique and truly delicious. Highly recommended! | If youGÇÖre looking for overpriced, poorly executed replicas of Mexican dishes, congratulations, youGÇÖve found your spot. The tortillas alone rank among the worst IGÇÖve had in recent memory.  A standout feature is the mandatory lightning-fast dining pace (relative to how slowly the food arrives), perfect if youGÇÖre searching for an excuse to cut the evening short. We were asked to leave within five minutes of our desserts hitting the table (desserts that took fifteen minutes to arrive and were impressively basic), and this came just five minutes after we were asked if weGÇÖd like another round of drinks.
El Grito Mexican Taqueria Mountjoy Square is a Mexican restaurant in Dublin. Customer reviews say: Had been to El Grito recently and loved it! The nachos were the highlight - tasty, filling, and full of flavor. The chimichanga was a great addition too, really delicious and satisfying. The chicken and Mexican rice soup with crispy nachos was hearty and comforting. Washed it all down with a refreshing Mexican mojito. The place has a lovely authentic Mexican vibe, and the staff were super cheerful and friendly. Great food, great atmosphere ,will definitely be back! =ƒî«G£¿ | El Grito is a fantastic Mexican restaurant in Dublin! The atmosphere is warm and welcoming, with charming d+¬cor that makes you feel right at home. The staff are always smiling and friendly, which adds to the pleasant experience.  I had a delicious burrito, paired with a Michelada GÇö absolutely amazing! The food is full of authentic flavors, the service is quick and efficient, and prices are fair and perfectly aligned with the quality offered. Highly recommended! | IGÇÖve just been to this Mexican restaurant in the middle of nowhere, and honestly, it blew me away. From the moment you walk in, the atmosphere, the music, the smells, the sounds, and the people make it feel absolutely mesmerizing.  Looking at the menu, I genuinely felt like I was back in Mexico. Every dish was bursting with flavorGÇötasty, fresh, and authentic. The guacamole was incredible, and the cocktail was spot on.  While I was there, I noticed two birthday parties being celebrated, and the staff were just amazingGÇöso happy, welcoming, and full of energy. You can tell they really enjoy what they do.  ItGÇÖs not a massive restaurant, but maybe thatGÇÖs what makes it so special. ItGÇÖs a hidden gem. If you want real Mexican food and the feeling of being in Mexico without leaving town, you need to visit this place. Plus we were welcomed without a reservation !!!!! | We tried the Tacos with chilli con carne, Alambre with barbacoa beef, and Burrito with Mexican beef; all were delicious! The sauces were spot on, nice and spicy.  The restaurant feels so cozy and genuinely Mexican. Perfect spot for good food and good vibes! | Absolutely delicious churros and tacos, would recommend! The sauces are all great as well. Cool decorations in the back area and clean bathrooms :)
AGAVE DUBLIN is a Mexican restaurant in Dublin. Customer reviews say: Great place! The portion of nachos is pretty big for the price and sauces are great. Burritos come fully loaded, the chicken one is a bit dry but the pulled pork one is fantastic. The place should have better ventilation, the air is a bit saturated. A part from that everything else was great. | Absolutely fantastic experience! We ordered nachos, enchiladas, chimichanga, and quesadillas GÇö and every single dish was fresh, bursting with flavor, and cooked to perfection. The ingredients tasted authentic and the portions were generous. The atmosphere is cosy and inviting, making it the perfect spot to relax and enjoy a delicious meal. Highly recommended for anyone craving real Mexican flavors! =ƒî«=ƒî»=ƒ½ö | Every time we have family or friends visiting, we always bring them here, with food this good, it would be a crime not to! The portions are generous, the flavors are amazing, and their churros are honestly the best IGÇÖve ever had. The staff are super friendly and welcoming, which makes the experience even better. TheyGÇÖre probably the reason IGÇÖm not getting any skinnier, but itGÇÖs so worth it. Such a great spot to share with people you love. | As a Mexican, I approve the flautas =ƒæî=ƒÅ+ they are delicious. I think they can improve their salsas, and their tortas de pastor. But in general it was good food. IGÇÖd go again | Found this diamond when visiting! Fresh and  tasty. Really nice atmosphere and you could see a lot of the customers were regulars which was a good sign. My friend was a vegetarian and they had lots of veggie options and I had the chilli beef burrito. Tastes like authentic Mexican street food - delicious. I will be back
Parrilla Ranelagh is a Mexican restaurant in Dublin. Customer reviews say: An absolutely incredible culinary experience. Impeccable food only matched by the wonderful service and care that the staff show to their customers. Jenny took care of us at front of house, while Rory's extensive menu knowledge allowed us to have a wonderful evening of different spices and flavours with the perfect cocktails to wash it all down. Highlight of the evening definitely the Tuna Tostadas which were simply sublime. Thanks to Parilla, Jenny and Rory for a magnificent evening | Amazing food, amazing atmosphere, amazing service. Jake our server was top class. And the other servers were great too. Highly recommend this place. Will be definitely be back over and over again | We visited Parrilla last evening for the first but definitely not the last time. From the moment we walked in to big smiles and a friendly welcome everything else was above our expectations. The setting, the atmosphere, the food and especially the service from Jake were all exceptional. Honestly the flavours were fantastic and the cocktails fabulous. I highly recommend you book a table and spoil yourself with as special an evening as we had. | This stunning Mexican restaurant is now open for lunch, and itGÇÖs an absolute must-visit. We booked outselves a table for 2pm and ordered six sharing-style dishes GÇö all beautifully presented, portioned nicely for the price.  The staff are fantastic GÇö genuinely friendly, attentive, and interested in how your day is going. The atmosphere is lively and full of energy, and their Margaritas are simply outstanding!  IGÇÖll definitely be back | We very much enjoyed our evening at Parrilla.  Lovely welcome and service, great ambience, and the FOOD. We shared most of the dishes and I am glad as I got so many different tastes. Super prawns and chicken tinga, also enjoyed the Mango Margarita lot. Pork ribs seemed pricey but offered a literal mountain of great tasting meat. More than happy to recommend.
Papi Chulo is a Mexican restaurant in Dublin. Customer reviews say: Food was great, all the ingredients were very fresh. The staff were very attentive and helpful with the menu. I ordered the the mucho meat box and portion size was great. I had very fresh tasting tortilla chips and and the chips were fresh to order and crispy. The only thing I would say was wrong was that the paper at the bottom of the box went soggy and when I was trying to scoop the last bits of my meal I was scooping up pieces of paper which I wouldnGÇÖt want to eat. | Great to have a Mexican in Dun Laoghaire - i hope it stays around! Veg tacos were a little messy but colourful, fresh and recommended.  For an extra 3 euro you can up your mains to a Meal Deal (not mentioned on their main menu screen) which makes it very good value. | We had a fantastic experience w Papi Chulo - ordered 12 burritos to be ready in time for our departure on race to Dingle.  Communication w Alyssa were awesome, Rafael and his co worker had our food perfectly prepared and labelled on time. The burritos reheated 8 hours later and were devoured by hungry crew. The burritos were absolutely delicious!  We will definitely make them our preferred suplier ! LOL. | I recently visited Papi Chulo and tried the Vegan Mexican bowl, which included black beans, rice, mushrooms, and a generous portion of cabbage salad by default. You can also choose sauces according to your personal taste.  The restaurant has a cute, cosy, and vibrant atmosphere. The prices are reasonable in relation to the quantity of food served, and the flavours were really enjoyable.  The staff is friendly, and there is a washroom available too. For parking, you can use nearby paid parking, which is just a five-minute walk to the restaurant. | Very bland food. They try to mask the lack of flavour by making the food spicy. Soft shell tacos arrived cold, not even somewhat warm. Burrito was tasteless.
Boojum - Liffey Valley is a Mexican restaurant in Dublin. Customer reviews say: Gé¼17.55 paid, and still don't know how it comes this price for a child dish=ƒÿæ this is nonsense price where a staff paid Gé¼12-13 per hour place... | IGÇÖve been meaning to write a review these past weeks but havenGÇÖt got on to doing it. I come here often on the weekend around lunchtime with my boyfriend. We often feel judged going out to eat, but never felt that way here. We are always greeted with a lovely smile from your staff. There is one young girl in particular who made our experience even better. She had brown hair and always has a big smile on her face. Overall experience was great as per usual but I just want to show my appreciation for your staff. Thanks Johnny | Food was good as always. I just find it bit pricey. I got salad bowl. The base prize of 8Gé¼ was just for bed of lettuce. Everything that was added on had price tagged to it. Maybe these guys need to work on salad bowls | Myself and my partner both got chicken burritos. We both took one bite and couldnGÇÖt eat anymore. It was ridiculously salty all I could taste was the salt. It actually hurt my tongue it was so salty. Place was very dirty too. The people working were absolutely fuming too. | Massive thanks to the team at liffey valley boojum, went in for a feed and I got one. Massive portions and food was amazing got the chicken and chilli con carne which was amazing it fed me for the day. Massive thanks to the team especially Aaron and niamh they went above and beyond to help me get my phone back before Xmas as I forgot it in the store. The effort they put in was unbelievable saved my Xmas and Aaron went out of his way to be a help with getting it back to me Massive respect for this crew can't wait to go back again for a fat burrito next time I'm in dublin. Thanks guys ya show that the irish always look after people the best we can
777 is a Mexican restaurant in Dublin. Customer reviews say: The place to go if youGÇÖre looking for great margaritas! Good variety of options for the drinks and the food was great as well, they recommend 2-3 smaller dishes, but 2 were enough for me and the rest of our company to be satisfied. The pork belly is great! | It's nice atmosphere, I've never been before this wa the first time, but i was well surprised! The food was delicious, and they have a few Vegan options, which i got for myself! My friends got the meat and fish dishes and they were very well pleased as well! So i give Four star because I think they could still expand the vegan options maybe for the new year, with Veganuary on the way! The staff was very polite and helpful, professional too! vwry good job! I would definitely recommend it | Ordered - CARNE ASADA (for two): 24 oz C+¦te de Boeuf, Black Beans, Pico de Gallo, Guacamole, Chimichurri, Elotes, Papas Fritas. Everything was cooked to perfection, I'm usually a picky eater but I had some of everything GÇö probably spurred on by the price I'd paid =ƒÿë GÇö and enjoyed it all! My date (who is Mexican) was similarly impressed with the food! The beef was juicy and flavourful, the assorted bits on the plate were each well done and paired nicely with it, the fried potatoes were crispy on the outside and perfectly softened inside, and the corn (elotes) was okay GÇö the smoky flavour was nice on it but there wasn't much to bite into (kernels didn't go very deep) I had a house ginger beer and she had a pinky tuscadero, both tasted good! There weren't any tables for two, so we were sat at the bar which was a little disappointing. The decoration in the indoor dining area was fun and pretty authentic. For me the music was playing just a little bit loud so it wasn't great for conversation, something the staff/management might review given that it was a Tuesday night and not a weekend. All in all still a great experience and would go again with more people if the music was a little quieter. We had been waiting to eat for a good few hours before arriving so we didn't wait to take a photo, photo credit to @867claireh on TripAdvisor. | Very nice tuna fresh Ceviche, although different from the Peruvian one, tasty tacos and amazing cocktails. The decor is top class. Good service too | AMAZING FOOD, AMAZING COCKTAILS! Some are not for the faint hearted, aka if you love heat, you will love the cocktails! Had 4 courses for -ú100 with drinks but wow, will be recommending to everyone when we come back to Dublin.
Zambrero Newcastle Road is a Mexican restaurant in Galway. Customer reviews say: Staff were absolutely lovely, and the food is fresh. However, the portions are absolutely TINY. I just had tacos that I finished in 6 bites, and my son's burrito was literally just rice,tiny bit of overspiced pork and a scraping of beans. Really disappointed and definitely won't be returning unless here the portions have improved | Staff were really nice and helpful. Food is absolutely amazing. Portion was so big i couldn't finish it all. Definitely my favorite food here. It's healthy it's tasty and it's quick service. | Bit cold with the door open and chairs arenGÇÖt comfy to eat in. Man serving was so helpful and made us some lovely food | Amazing food ordered a chicken burrito and some nachos truly sensational. | Portions are consistently too small for wha you get, not worth it!! However The odd staff member does a fair sized portion
Londis Wellpark Galway is a Mexican restaurant in Galway. Customer reviews say: Spotted good deal of breakfast roll containing 6 items plus a bewleys coffee this monring for Gé¼6. Good deal I thought. Asked at deli for breakfast roll for sausages and egg. Deli counter asked if I want 2 of each and I said OK. Got my small coffee which happend to be insomnia and not bewleys. Went to counter and was asked for Gé¼7.90. I pointed out the Gé¼6 deal and was informed that it only applies to a 6 item roll. I pointed out that means I'm paying more for less. Like a computer I was told it has to be 6 items.Probably becuase of the deli barcode ? So I just said thanks and walked away and they can eat and drink the items tehmselves. Probably should have returned to the deli counter for more items but to be honest the whole episode annoyed me and that is the worst part because life is short and this type of nonsense is'nt worth getting annoyed about. Still here I am typing out my thoughts on the issue so I must be bothered. Cash register should flag only if roll has more items not if less. Not really interested in going back there again despite the food looking good. Makes me wonder why I was asked at Deli for 2 of each or not told how that would impact on the advertised deal? | Healthy, Fresh & Super Convenient!  Chopped is a  food takeaway tucked inside Londis Wellpark.  The food is incredibly fresh, full of flavour, and perfect if youGÇÖre trying to eat well but donGÇÖt have time to cook. I tried the buddha bowl and my son had a chicken wrap with lots of green.  Both were delicious.  The staff were friendly and quick, and I loved that there was parking outside.  ItGÇÖs great having a healthy option inside a shop, especially one that doesnGÇÖt compromise on taste or quality.  Highly recommend if youGÇÖre looking for a wholesome meal on the run. IGÇÖll definitely be back! | I had a very strange and rude interaction before with a girl that worked in the deli. She acted like she owned the place and spoke to us like we were stupid - when called out on it she went over to the till to gossip with coworkers before we paid and then watched us out the door as we crossed the road to the bus stop. I actually havenGÇÖt been back to the shop since that day. I lived near by and would walk further just to go to Lidl or DugganGÇÖs instead. Sad because I used to spend money there nearly every day. | Love my local Londis, nice to see such a great variety of groceries. But the best part is the staff who work nights....Always so helpful and friendly but there's one in particular that goes the extra mile always, Nihar and always with a big smile on his face. Keep up the good work and top customer service. | Best spot in Wellpark for a healthy lunch. I always go to the Chopped counterGÇöthe ingredients are consistently fresh and the staff are fast even during the 1:00 PM rush. It is a bit pricier than a standard sandwich, but you definitely 'pay for what you get' in terms of quality. Plenty of parking and the seating area is always clean. Great for a quick stop-off."
Menlo Park Hotel is a Mexican restaurant in Galway. Customer reviews say: We had a fantastic one-night stay! The service was exceptional, staff were incredibly friendly and helpful, and everything was spotless. The hotel itself is beautifully designed, with a warm and welcoming atmosphere. Free parking was a big plus, and the on-site restaurant was absolutely amazing. The staff also gave us great local tips, which made our brief stay even better. WeGÇÖll definitely be recommending this place to friends and family visiting Galway! | one of our favorite hotels. the rooms are so comfy and the bathtub is wonderful! perfect place to relax and unwind after busy days. we stayed for three nights. the staff is also amazing and so friendly. the breakfast was also surprisingly really good! definitely consider staying here while in galway. we would book again | Excellent Experience at the Hotel!  We stayed at this hotel for one night and had an amazing experience. The location is easy to access, and the ambiance is beautiful and welcoming. We were lucky enough to get an upgrade to a suite, which was a wonderful surprise. The room was spacious, well-decorated, with fresh towels and high-quality amenities. In addition, there were chocolates, coffee, tea, and complimentary water in the room GÇô a really nice touch!  Since there was a heavy storm outside, we decided to stay in and enjoy the hotelGÇÖs restaurant. We were given two coupons for hot wine, which was perfect for the weather. We also ordered a pepperoni pizza and wings, both of which were delicious! The breakfast, served buffet-style, was very complete, with a wide variety of options for every taste.  Overall, our stay was an excellent choice. The hotel provides a full, high-quality experience. We highly recommend it and will definitely return! | We had a 2 night stay in Dec for the Galway Christmas markets. It was a perfect place to stay just outside the busy city and easy to get to just off the main carriage way. There's a bus stop at the hotel so we didn't have to deal with the traffic or parking in the city centre which was a huge plus and only took 10 to 15mins to Eyre Sq. The Hotel is lovely warm and inviting. All the staff from front of house , the servers even the house keeping were so courteous and were a delight to deal with. I've never been to such a more welcoming place. It was so great to see so many different gluten free options as well as other dietary requirements available on all the food menus from breakfast to evening meals. Although very busy when we were there due to Christmas party lunches and dinners the staff did not show one sign of pressure they were all under, perfessionalism shown through out the evening from all staff. It was an absolute pleasure to stay here and highly recommend it to anyone. We will definitely be returning for a very peaceful get away. | Great stay overall, really enjoyed the place. Room was clean, comfortable, and quiet at night. Staff was friendly and always happy to help. Would definitely stay here again next time.
Jemi Lighthouse is a Mexican restaurant in Galway. Customer reviews say: Vegan review:  I got a chai latte to start with and ordered whatever the special was, basically a beautiful Thai red tasting curry with brown rice. It was so flavoursome and lovely. My hubby (omnivore) got the Mexican sweet potato bowl and really enjoyed it.  I then got a mint tea and lovely carrot cake.  Service was great and staff were really friendly.  Would definitely recommend it! | Such a lovely place! The staff is friendly and the environment is cozy. I ate a bowl with roasted pumpkin and vegan feta which was epic! I also recommend trying their Masala Chai, absolutely loved it! | We popped in for a late lunch and had a delightful squash salad. Everyone was really personable and attentive. The food was absolutely lovely! I'll be back! | Lovely staff- thank you! I was left hungry though...! Food arrived, tasted grand but portion size was TINY- and I'd consider myself someone with a very small appetite. To charge Gé¼17 for a vegetarian (vegan?) dish and for it to be SO small feels a little bit cheeky. | Enjoyed a wonderful lunch today in the company of other travelers in this exciting city of Galway. It was a nice surprise to stumble upon a restaurant that catered to my dietary needs. The menu wasn't overwhelming and there was a nice variety of choices to choose from. I ordered the Terryland Reuben with a vegan cheese which was VERY good and afterwards enjoyed a complimentary slice of vegan cake that was absolutely lovely. The portions were perfect! I actually left with the cake in a take out container. If you're looking for a quaint and affordable restaurant to enjoy a vegan meal, this is the place!
Gigas Dinergrill Oranmore is a Mexican restaurant in Galway. Customer reviews say: Very good food. I tried a kebab here, and itGÇÖs one of the best you gotta find in Ireland. The staff is very nice and welcomes you with a smile. | Great spot in Oranmore for food. Tucked around the back of the Porter house. It's outdoor seating or takeaway so be prepared. The staff are always friendly and accommodating of dietary restrictions where possible. The food is delicious, especially any of the burgers. Lots of seating available so it's a great spot to catch up with friends. | Got a spice bag and it was inedible. Dangerous levels of salt. Ordered a few hours ahead of time but still had to wait 15 minutes. Burger tasted fine but was small considering it cost almost Gé¼10. | amazing food with a fast service. everybody is super friendly and theres a great atmosphere Would recommend any day of the week | One of the best hamburgers my family and I have ever tried, it was completely worth driving from Galway. I recommend it 100%, the flavor was so tasty.. (We were so hungry we didn't take pictures, but nice presentation) =ƒç¬=ƒç¿=ƒÆù=ƒç¿=ƒç«
Banditos Galway is a Mexican restaurant in Galway. Customer reviews say: Great taste, portion size and value.  Tacos come in a four pack.  Staff are friendly and helpful.  If you have a Mexican craving, this is the spot to hit. | Love  the food here normally .I only have a burrito when I'm in oranmore such a disappointment Saturday evening is not very busy The burrito was full of rice, a bad  taste of burn, and very dry. .It's such a shame. Hopefully, it will get better | Quick service. Great food! The chicken and beef are just perfect, not overly salty like other restaurants. Their chipotle sauce is awesome!Many people came by and order while we were there. Don't trust those people who gave bad review because of slight online order mistake. | Was there twice since I moved here in March.  Burrito or take away is  a real treat for me as I don't get it often.  The food and quality is really good and tastes,  great place  however both times I was let down. , the Burrito size was really  just not up to standard,   for the price especially if you add xtra meat almost 16 or 17 euro with a drink =ƒñö I'd expect it to be bursting , it was too small not enough filling loosely wraped and left me hungry ,and not value for money , =ƒÿö it's been a while I go there tomorrow and hope fof redemption , | Probably the best burrito I've had in Ireland. Tasty and fresh ingredients, quick service. Good location not hard to find parking nearby. Will definitely be back.
Sonny Molloy's is a Mexican restaurant in Galway. Customer reviews say: We stopped in while on a tour through town. The place is stylish inside and much larger than it looks. We happened to luck out that the All Irish Rugby final was on that day so we got to watch some of it. We were seated promptly despite the game being about to start. Service was courteous and efficient. We both ordered Shepard's Pie and I ordered a pint of the local red ale. Everything was very good and we enjoyed our time here. | Food was very quick, chicken wings and margarita pizza was yummy. What I did not like  was the toilets. Very tiny bathroom and the seats were small and loose so they were moving . It was disgusting when your buddy was touching the bowl. | One of the best pubs in Galway!  Huge place with loads of tables and different bar stations. Friendly staff with great vibes.  Food was delicious, the roast of the day was excellent and the pint was super tasty. Next time IGÇÖll have to try their own stout. | We had a quick stop at Sonny Molloy's when the rain picked up.  We were just there for a pint.  As we sat at the bar we were perusing the whiskey selection and I can say it was impressive!  We chatted with the bartender and learned a bit about the collection.  This pub is fantastic.  Its atmosphere is warm and charming.  SUCH a great find.  If I'm ever back in Galway, I'll definitely return and spend some time! | Stopped in for a quick Irish coffee, stayed for a couple pints after that. Nice cozy spot. Bartenders friendly and welcoming- even when it gets very busy :)
The Chili Shack Galway is a Mexican restaurant in Galway. Customer reviews say: DELICIOUS FOOD! We tried them during our visit to Galway and were amazed. The chicken wings, wrap, and zingers were cooked perfectly and satisfied our spicy taste buds. I am very selective when it comes to wings and these guys are doing it right. The staff is very courteous and helped us navigate the menu. Highly recommend them. | I cannot recommend this restaurant enough. The staff was so so friendly and helpful, especially with advice with the menu. The food was unbelievable. Cooked fresh right there and was absolutely delicious. 10/10. Restaurant was immaculately clean too. Definitely going back again | I tried the chicken wings and the bacon cheese burger. Both were delicious. The wings were perfectly cooked, and the burger was juicy with the right balance of toppings. Definitely a must-try spot in Galway for anyone craving quality food. | I always order take out from Chili Shack and they never disappoint me. The burgers are super delicious, the chips are great, even some of the cookies that come with the meals are sooooo delicious. Everything is top quality, the food always comes nice and warm, and the delivery is fast. Probably my favorite burgers in Galway. Totally recommend, well deserved 5 stars. | Been going here for years for the chilli chips and can easily say itGÇÖs Michelin star worthy. However, I recently saw the business up for sale and noticed there are new staff. We recently got the chilli chips twice and it just wasnGÇÖt the same. I was so sad because it was such a good thing for so long. The mince wasnGÇÖt the same flavour and it tasted like it needed cooking for longer. I really hope they can achieve it the same way as it was as it truly was something spectacular!!!
Elephant & Castle Galway is a Mexican restaurant in Galway. Customer reviews say: The establishment is very beautiful, but there is not really a choice in food.  We waited 40 minutes for our order, given that there were only 3 tables occupied in the room.  Both our soup and burger were simply heated up.  If you like to take pictures, you will like it.  If you eat it, I donGÇÖt recommend it | I recently visited Elephant and Castle with two friends, and from the moment we arrived, the experience was wonderful. We were greeted by a lovely waitress who was warm, polite, and attentive. She quickly brought over a jug of water and took our drinks order, which set the tone for a relaxed evening. We decided to try three different cocktails, and each one was absolutely delicious.  For mains, two of us went for the chicken schnitzel while the third ordered fish and chips. When the food arrived, it looked incredibleGÇöand tasted even better. I completely cleared my plate, and IGÇÖm still dreaming about it. The creamy smoked bacon parmesan mash was out of this world, and paired with the rich, velvety basil cream pea sauce, it was the perfect comfort dish. Honestly, I canGÇÖt stop thinking about itGÇötake me back right now!  Between the friendly service, the amazing cocktails, and that unforgettable meal, Elephant and Castle has firmly secured a spot on my GÇ£must-returnGÇ¥ list. | Staff were lovely and very helpful - cannot fault them!  Food was awful. We orders the dirty chicken nachos to share as a starters and it was the worst I ever had. The cheese was hard and the chicken was just chopped up breaded chicken fillets - presentation was 0/10 - this was the most expensive starter around Gé¼18. Not a great start.  We had the salmon and beef mains - neither of us finished them. Extremely disappointing as the atmosphere is lovely & staff are great. Our total was Gé¼115. I was sick paying it!! This hasnGÇÖt been my first time here but will definitely be my last. | The food was very disappointing.  It was my first time dining here and we were out celebrating a Birthday. It was an expensive meal, and if the food was enjoyable then I wouldn't have minded paying this, but the roast beef was close to cold when it came out, the yorkshire pudding was cut in half and stale, and I was served the wrong drink. I mentioned this to the waiter but no offer to reheat it for me or pass word on to the kitchen. Sadly, the desserts were nothing to rave about, and considering the price I was expecting a slightly bigger portion or more to it. On the positive side, the appetisers were delicious and hot, and the atmosphere was amazing. Apart from those two details, I wont be returning. | Disappointed!! We had reserved a table of 4,seemed like a busy Saturday Night. IGÇÖve been to this restaurant in Dublin before and honestly comparing the service was terrible in Galway. If you can avoid. We spent about 140 on the 4of us,ordered wine and waited about 20mins to receive it after everyone else got their drinks. I did ask to change my order and she walked off mid sentence. The food was good but the server looking after us wasnGÇÖt very attentive.  At the end of our meal we asked to get the burger and cauliflower bites wrapped up,got home and it was burger and chips.  We are all in our early 20s and expect the same service youGÇÖd give to everyone else.  My advice learn to listen
Park House Hotel is a Mexican restaurant in Galway. Customer reviews say: Beautiful hotel in prime Galway area with great service.  Room was fantastic and spacious (was had a triple room) and clean.  Hotel staff are fantastic and helpful, from the front desk, parking attendants, to the restaurant servers.  Location is fantastic for walking to the main areas or waterfront.  Only tricky thing for us was a lot of traffic when coming into town and finding the parking.  That info was in our email, but we didn't read thoroughly prior to arrival.  We arrived on a busy Friday afternoon.  Would definitely stay here again. | Beautiful hotel in the heart of Galway just across from Eyre Square and within walking distance of the pedestrian shopping district and plenty of pubs to choose from!  Even though youGÇÖre right across from all the action, the noise is instantly closed off when you enter the hotel. The staff was incredibly helpful and the restaurant was top notch. One of the best meals we had in Ireland!  10/10 recommend park house hotel. | Stayed for one night on 20th December 2 adults 2 children in a suite room. Fantastic location right off eyre square, room was excellent, size, cleanliness  and functionality. Hostess in the bar was extremely rude and dismissive which was the only negative experience and very unlike the rest of the staff as Philip the duty manager was excellent great communication style and level of service was excellent even with such as busy restaurant. Reception staff extremely friendly and concierge staff equally so. Breakfast was excellent as was dinner some excellent menu options. Overall a really good experience despite one staff member who really doesnGÇÖt belong in the service industry. | We stayed in Dec 25, with 6 adults and an infant. Rooms were sizeable, lovely and clean, location was fantastic but above all else was the service. The staff couldnGÇÖt do enough for us. Nothing was too much trouble and it really felt like they cared. The food in the restaurant for breakfast and dinner were both superb. Galway is such an amazing city and the visit was made all the better for this hotel. CanGÇÖt recommend highly enough. | Just back from a 2 night stay. Stay in Galway for a couple of nights annually. First time in the Park House, and we will be back.  The staff from the porter parking our car to the receptionist and friendly bar and restaurant staff were all superb. We ate dinner in the hotel on our 2nd night. The choices were excellent with no supplement for the perfectly cooked steak. Deserts and cheeseboard all great. Breakfast on both mornings had great choices including the kippers and cod, which we had.
Shake Dog Galway is a Mexican restaurant in Galway. Customer reviews say: Wow!  As North Americans traveling abroad, our stay in Galway had us close to this diner, so we just couldn't resist!   Tucked away in a modern commercial park, this hidden gem has done a credible job of replicating the look and feel of an "American Diner "  A few of the menu items had a local twist (like a hamburger bowl, a burger with cheese in a salad bowl) but for the most part, it's "Burgers and fries and milkshakes!". They even refer to the deep fried potato sticks as.....Fries!!  Prices were very reasonable, with table service (they took our order and brought it to us).   The only thing they didn't have were stools at the counter for counter seating and non-stop coffee drinking!  But really, this place was pretty cool. | Clean, well kept, beautiful interior. Fast service and preparation. Kind staff. Great selection of food and drinks. Delicious and well priced. I got a chicken hawaii burger and a biscoff shake. Tasted exactly how itGÇÖs supposed to. Awesome music. Literally the song I was listening to before I entered. Absolutely nothing to complain about even if I wanted to. | The food is freshly made and so tasty. The burger in a bowl is delicious as well as the fried chicken plate (forgot the nameGÇª=ƒÖä).  The staff is lovely. You can order at the table and donGÇÖt have to pay before you have finished your meal.  If you like a hot dog, give it a go =ƒÿï We will definitely be back to eat our way through the menu. Gÿÿn+Å | Very pleasant service and fast plenty of seats. But up there with the worst food i have ever tasted. Chips tasted funny. Chicken wings soft and fatty. Never again. Horrendous | Nice enough restaurant. The food was okay. Chicken tenders were nice but nothing came with them, no salad etc. The burger was nice, but again was just a burger on its own. Their staff were very friendly and the decor is nice. ItGÇÖs ideal before a Connacht game, or a cinema trip,  but not for an evening meal out.
Jalan Jalan Galway is a Mexican restaurant in Galway. Customer reviews say: Nice pan Asian restaurant near the university. We were a party of 2 and ordered spring rolls, chicken yakisoba, and prawn pad Thai. Very good taste wise, not too spicy. Portions were somewhat small and we were still hungry so we ordered mochi ice cream. This was also good but strangely took almost 10 minutes to come out, and we were basically the only customers in the restaurant. Great option for Chinese/Asian food in Galway. | If you donGÇÖt like or canGÇÖt have spicy food, this is not your restaurant =ƒÿà everything is super spicy there. The restaurant is clean and nice, the quality of food is good, but nowhere on the menu the level of being spicy of each dish is mentioned and even if you ask, they answer not much, while itGÇÖs too much=ƒî¦n+Å=ƒÑ¦ | My most favourite spot in galway G¥ñn+Å  They have the best menu =ƒÄë  My fav is chicken fried rice and thai green curry =ƒì¢  Kids friendly =ƒÿÄ  Friendly staff I loved her way of speaking G¥ñn+Å  I will visit this place often =ƒÿè  Must try =ƒÆ» | Delicious food and kind service in a restaurant with a clean, cozy atmosphere | A combination of Asian best. You can find Thai, Malay, Hong Kong, and pan-asian cuisine in this place! Superb taste! Jalan Jalan brings Galway closer to Southeast Asia than ever! Highly recommended!
Boojum - Galway is a Mexican restaurant in Galway. Customer reviews say: Great value for money packaged in a huge burrito made to order. It's not authentic West Coast fish, but if you've got a big appetite and skinny wallet, you can't do better.  The table area could be cleaner, and the staff a bit less surly, but an overall good fast food experience. | In Oct 2025 we brought a group of 20 young people and 4 youth workers to Boojum. The staff were incredible at keeping on top of all of the orders. Service was friendly, efficient, and the food was delicious. Thank you so much to all the Boojum staff for a fab lunch! | I was really disappointed with my recent visit to Boojum. I ordered a burrito bowl and found a large dead fly in it. When I went back to let the staff know, the person who served me didnGÇÖt apologise or offer a refund. They just made me a new bowl, which wasnGÇÖt even properly filled and felt very half-hearted. Definitely not the level of hygiene or customer service IGÇÖd expect. Really put me off going back. | My friend and I enjoyed a lovely set of tacos, burrito bowl, and guacamoleGÇª and I loved the lively discussion with the owner! Highly recommended GÇª muy rico! | I want to shout out Omid for his exceptional customer service! Never have I been served by someone so happy to help - the first thing we all said when we sat down was how kind and excited to serve us he was. He brightened our day=ƒîƒ=ƒîƒ
Tuco's Taqueria is a Mexican restaurant in Galway. Customer reviews say: Ordered 2 burritos and 2 cokes,  left a 5 euro tip.  38 euro, enough for what it is.  The food was good I was sorry I left the tip as the girl who left the two burritos on the counter didn't have the courtesy to tell me which had chilli and which was beef.  The toilets were horrible, floor covered in urine also. | Vacationing here and this place is a gem. The food is super fresh and delicious. If I lived in the area, the Paleo box would be my go to lunch choice. | I visited this place today and absolutely loved it. The atmosphere is very cozy and quiet, especially on the second floor. The staff were incredibly friendly and attentive, and they calmly helped me choose what to order, which was really appreciated, as the menu can be a bit overwhelming. I truly enjoyed the food, and their chicken is absolutely delicious. Highly recommended! | Cracking quesadilla: properly loaded, golden, and exactly what you want when you order one. The hot sauce on the side was the real standout, deep, punchy heat without killing the flavour.  Shout-out to Mohammad for top-class service too friendly, fast, and genuinely sound. Simple food done right, with great people behind it. Would happily go back. | Amazing food at Tuco! The staff were also super friendly and lovely. Will definitely come back again!
Alma Restaurant is a Mexican restaurant in Galway. Customer reviews say: This is a MUST when visiting Galway.  YouGÇÖll get your fill of stew and fish nGÇÖ chips other nights youGÇÖre here. YouGÇÖll be blown away the flavors, textures and aromas this place conjures.  Seriously, itGÇÖs only two people, wife/husband, who run this restaurant and itGÇÖs phenomenal!  We really lucked out when finding this place.  We ordered the pork, goat cheese and Brazilian sausage, house red and finished up with Amarguinha (Portuguese almond liquor). Hands down the best meal IGÇÖve had in a long time, maybe years.  The owners were so friendly and cute, very happy and hospitable. | We waited 55 minutes to have our main course.  Octopus and monkfish. For the price 28Gé¼/dish, we were expecting a good portion with octopus and fish. It is mainly rice and sauce with 3 miserable piece of fish and 3 prawns, for the octopus better not to say anything. There were one person cooking and one person serving they were overwhelmed. We went to this restaurant because of the comments and pictures but finally the pictures of the plates are not at all what is in the reel menu once in the restaurant. The taste is not bad but it is not waw neither. So expect rice and sauce with 2 or 3 octopus or fish. I donGÇÖt e omens specially that in the town there is many restaurant well noted and well served. Ps: I donGÇÖt reply usually to manager response but I want to precise for you that eating only burger is not my best when I say other restaurant that serve good home cooked plates has the same price and better servedGÇª... And waiting 55 minGÇª. best of luck for your business. Attached some photos from other restaurant in Galway home cooked plates the bill was the same as in your restaurant but we have appetizers and main course and drinkGÇª.. donGÇÖt get me wrong please. Best of luck for you and your clients but this is my opinion | A culinary gem in Galway  A visit to this restaurant is a truly unmissable experience. The cuisine is a mix of innovation and tradition, with dishes that enhance the quality and authenticity of the ingredients. Every bite is a true delight for the palate, thanks to flavors and aromas that enchant the senses.  The owners, a husband and wife couple, run the place with passion and dedication, creating a warm and welcoming atmosphere. The service is exceptional: attentive, kind, and full of care. You can feel a sincere love for cooking and hospitality, which makes every meal unforgettable.  The menu offers a wide choice, from classic dishes to more unique specialties, such as the influences of Portuguese and Brazilian cuisine. The pairing with an excellent selection of wines makes the experience even more complete. Don't hesitate to try the rib of beef, which stands out for its tenderness and flavor.  This is a place that surprises and wins you over, leaving you wanting to come back. If you are in Galway, don't miss the opportunity to discover this rare gem, where the passion for food and the care for the customer merge into an extraordinary culinary experience. Ivan & Lu | Amazing food! My family and I discovered this restaurant while visiting Galway, and we were pleasantly surprised by how excellent everything was. Every meal was perfectly cooked, warm, and full of flavor. The staff were incredibly attentive and friendly, making the whole experience even better. Absolutely worth every penny GÇö we canGÇÖt wait to come back to Galway just to eat here again! | This is a relatively small Portuguese restaurant specializing in seafood. There is a husband and wife team who own the restaurant and handle most of the cooking and serving. The food is inspired by Goa in India and the food has complex and delicious flavours.
Chopped is a Mexican restaurant in Galway. Customer reviews say: Great to have a healthy food option that tastes just as good | Thank you Jennifer - so helpful and really cheerful. So nice for a bit of niceness and normality in 2020 =ƒÿü | Had a warp in there before it was lovely, but last day I had a soup and it was awful felt like the was half of the cup of salt in it, I was very hungry so ended up eating the thing and avoiding the liquid and ended up in trouble couple hours later. probably worst soup IGÇÖve ever had. WonGÇÖt be back after this | Had my first Chopped salad today and it was so nice. Really fresh ingredients and loads of toppings to choose from. Staff were really friendly and took time to explain the different options. Guy serving me gave me his recommendation (Mexican chicken) and it was great. Quite reasonably priced too. Will definitely be back. | This place is more times closed than actually open! Came here Thursday 1pm. And itGÇÖs closed. Hire more staff maybe ???
Supermac's & Papa John's Eyre Square is a Mexican restaurant in Galway. Customer reviews say: Supermac's in Galway truly lives up to the hype. This iconic fast-food chain delivers on its reputation for delicious and satisfying meals.  The bacon cheeseburger, which was juicy, flavourful, and perfectly cooked. The combination of crispy bacon and melted cheese checked all the boxes for this the classic burger experience.  The service was quick and friendly, making it a great spot for a tasty and convenient meal. Whether you're a local or just passing through, Supermac's in Galway is a must-visit if you are having a craving for burgers and fries. | Today i took veg pizza and it was the worst pizza i had in my life. 1. Raw mushrooms 2. Too much waterery 3. Half cooked  Taste was pathetic=ƒñ«. Really disappointed. | Food and service was good. Great decor every Supermac should look like this one. =ƒÿë  ItGÇÖs busy but well kept and clean. | Was so happy to find this supermacs as they do gluten free menu and my husband has to have gluten free. It is usually very difficult to find somewhere to eat. The man who served us was very helpful and everything was tasty and my husband had no reactions so will eat there again when we return to Galway =ƒæì=ƒæì=ƒæì | Ordered 2 X breakfast rolls with coffee and tea. Weren't left waiting long and when I brought them down to table, opened them and immediately sealed them back up again..... Manager gave me a refund after telling me I was wrong..... Omg, RAW rashers and a total mess. I or my partner were not eating that!!! The owner does spot checks so please read this, check out this spot and order this before someone gets food poisoning. A disgrace of a Supermacs. Love Supermacs but this place really let's them down.
Deelys Cafe is a Mexican restaurant in Galway. Customer reviews say: A quiet Wednesday morning, with a lovely friendly young woman serving (the fellow might be called GÇ£gruffGÇ¥!). Delicious scrambled eggs with a side of soda bread and a mocha with Lavazza coffee. Oops nearly finished before I took the photo! Had a pot of tea afterwards as I took my time | Food is fine. Waits are long. What is shocking is the floor staff being roared at from the kitchen. I donGÇÖt think I have ever experienced the likes of it before. In fairness to the floor staff they are running and have a steep stairs to navigate!  Roaring at staff is unacceptable! | We found this small, rustic and cozy caf+¬ thanks to a localGÇÖs recommendation GÇö and what a great find it was! I really wanted a proper Irish breakfast, which is usually tricky because my wife is vegetarian. But unlike most pubs, this place truly has something for everyone (all coffee drinks available with oat milk, etc.).  The lady behind the counter was super friendly, attentive, and quick. You order at the counter and the food is brought to your table GÇö and even though the place was absolutely packed and she was working on her own, everything came out fast and with a smile.  ThereGÇÖs a big selection of homemade smoothies that perfectly round off the experience. Prices are very reasonable GÇö actually a bit cheaper than most other caf+¬s GÇö and the portion sizes were spot on. The coffee was huge, and the food was delicious, freshly made, and arrived sizzling hot. Always a good sign!  I honestly donGÇÖt understand why this place doesnGÇÖt have more stars. Our visit was wonderful, and I can highly recommend it to anyone hungry or thirsty in Galway in the morning. | DonGÇÖt go here. ThereGÇÖs a really bad atmosphere caused by the rude staff. The waitress was very friendly but the lady taking orders and the chef were really rude and also treated the waitress completely unfairly, shouting at her making everyone there uncomfortable. The cleanliness and food was also poor. Would not recommend and think they should rethink how they treat their staff. | Just happy with this place. ItGÇÖs the first place where I had a coffee and Irish breakfast last year. Went there several times. Today I came here again with friends. The service was great and all of us were happy with the food and drinks. Thanks!
Salsa is a Mexican restaurant in Galway. Customer reviews say: Nice food, very authentic. Lovely pulled pork. Sauces where tasty too. Tofas came with a consomme broth real mexican flavours, gorgeous. Not a huge amount of seating about six tables, two large. Nice staff. Not the cheapest but it is good quality and authentic so worth the price.  Sum up credit card so expect to tip. Clean up after yourself is not unusual for Galway. | Me and my friends went there this past weekend and OMG! WHAT A DELICIOUS EXPERIENCE =ƒñ¬ We ordered Torta al Pastor, Barbacoa Tacos and Alambre and EVERY DISH WAS TASTY AND SO GOOD! Our favourite Mexican place in Galway! The service was also AMAZING! Kudos to the chef that made us try an amazing DESSERT: Cari+¦o! Deep fried tortilla filled with strawberries and chocolate TRY IT!!!! | Wow, amazing food! This was a delicious meal of Mexican food. Recommend it very much 10/10! Lovely service and cosy small  interior.  Loved it! Tha k you very much! | Delicious food, friendly service, and great value. Variety of Authentic Mexican food options. | Really enjoyed Salsa! I had a burrito and it was filling, tasty, and well put togetherGÇögreat balance of flavours and generous portions. The place also has colourful d+¬cor and a relaxed vibe. Service was quick too, making it perfect for a casual lunch or a quick pit stop before heading home
Skeffington Arms Hotel is a Mexican restaurant in Galway. Customer reviews say: Ladies at the front desk were great and very responsive. The lady and gentleman in the breakfast area were very accommodating. The chef did a great job at preparing specialty omelettes The fire alarm killed my sleep the last night there. Hotel is located in an ideal spot to the city centre. | Great place to stay in central Galway. Nice room, great breakfast and lovely pub/restaurant downstairs with live music most nights. Our room was very quiet (217) with no noise from the pub. Only negative is there is no parking and you have to navigate the multi story car park at the mall around the corner. Special rate of 10 Euros per night. | Stayed one night.  Hotel double room smallish, as youGÇÖd expect from a historic, city centre building, but clean, well considered and practical.  The coffee maker is a nice touch. Only downside was that the heater/aircon unit made weird noises. The soundproofing seemed to be really doing its job though, considering that we were on top of a busy pub with a band playing, we really couldnGÇÖt hear much from outside the room.  The pub itself is a sight to behold. Amazing back bar, stained glass, split levels, expansive collection of whiskies, decent range of beers, a cocktail bar upstairs, live music most (if not every) nightGÇª we didnGÇÖt eat, but the offerings looked good.  WeGÇÖd definitely stay here again. | The hotel is city center, right by the tourist activity and only a 15 minute walk to some of the more local areas. Rooms were clean & spacious. Staff was extremely courteous, even calling after our stay to ensure we didnGÇÖt leave anything in the room. Only downside is the bar downstairs. They do play music until 2am, which we could hear in our room followed by the staff cleaning up after that. Our room was a few floors directly above the bar, so maybe a different location in the hotel would be better. | I had an amazing two nights at the Skeff! You can't ask for a better location in Galway, right on the square next to the Latin Quarter, one block from the train station. The breakfast is great, the pub below is great. I had a quieter room with zero noise issues. As I only stayed two nights, I left the no service needed sign on the door but the kind staff left a bag of linens, water, and cookies outside of my door. Would highly recommend and stay again when I return to Galway.
The Ardilaun Bistro is a Mexican restaurant in Galway. Customer reviews say: My wife and I and our infant daughter came in to get some lunch. We had to look around for someone to tall us about seating. Many of the tables were un-bussed. The two tables open were sticky and with crumbs over them.  The staff, and there were 5 standing around, did not even acknowledge us for 10 minutes. Drinks and ordering was very slow. We ordered two lunch meals but after 40 minutes they were not brought.  It was not busy. After an hour of waiting I got up and asked and the food had never been ordered.  No one came over to us to check on us. I informed the one person that was new on the scene that we did not want to wait and we were leaving and that the service was very poor. We were not asked to pay the tab and we agreed. Hopefully they can get their act together because it is a nice hotel. 2 stars for atmosphere only. | During an early spring visit to Galway, we found ourselves at the Ardilaun Hotel, meeting friends amidst warm and blustery weather. Nestled on the hills with the wind from the Bay, the hotel exudes charm. We decided to dine at their Bistro, drawn by its inviting bright wood accents, large menu, fully stocked bar, and an impressive selection of beers on tap.  We started our evening with a variety of drinks: a selection of whiskeys including Hennessy and Jameson, a margarita, a few pints of Moretti, and a glass of Crucero. The bartender was friendly and knowledgeable, enhancing our experience as we chatted about the different options available.  For starters, we chose the Indian Dip and Wild Mushrooms. The Indian Dip, reminiscent of hummus, was a delightful mixture of curry spices and coarse chickpeas, served with Naan. The Wild Mushrooms, cooked in garlic butter and parsley, came with sourdough bread and 'rocket' (arugula). These starters were the highlight of our meal, especially the Mushrooms, which were prepared to perfection and could easily be the centerpiece of any meal.  Our entrees included a Steak Sandwich, Thai Curry, Chicken Goujons, Sirloin Steak, and Chicken Supreme. Each dish was a testament to the capable fare of a good hotel restaurant. I enjoyed a well-cooked sirloin with chunky chips, perfectly complemented by my whiskey. The Thai Curry, a vegetarian dish, stood out for its clean finish and rich flavors, while the Chicken Goujons were akin to chicken tenders in the States, satisfying and familiar.  The young, friendly staff added to the pleasant dining experience. After dinner, we relaxed in the hotel's warm and cozy lobby, furnished with cushy chairs and a few intriguing goods to browse. I particularly enjoyed reading about the hotel and their selection of Midleton whiskey. The grounds and gardens of the hotel were in full bloom, adding to the overall charm of our visit.  For anyone seeking a pleasant escape from gloomy weather, the Ardilaun Bistro and the hotel's lobby offer a great way to spend an evening. The combination of good food, friendly service, and a welcoming atmosphere makes it a memorable experience. | Waiting for 45 minutes for food only to find out that the staff forgot to put the order through.  The only reason why i didnt check it earlier because its not a first time ardilaun's kitchen takes time to cook the food, and its not even busy.  Point is, if you dont want to spend at least half an hour waiting for a kids chicken nuggets, go somewhere else.  Waste of time! | We were residents at the hotel with our children and were availing of the gym and pool facilities during our stay. As it didnGÇÖt make sense to drive into Galway city for dinner, we opted to dine at the bistro downstairs on two separate occasions. Unfortunately, we were extremely disappointed both times.  The quality of the food was very poor. On our first visit, we ordered a chicken wrap and a chicken sandwichGÇöboth arrived with what appeared to be shredded chicken bits rather than properly prepared fillings. It was difficult to
Vocho is a Mexican restaurant in Galway. Customer reviews say: Probably one of the tastiest burritos IGÇÖve ever had. The sweet potato was so tasty and there were loads of veggie options; my only criticism is it could maybe do with having less rice as it was so big I couldnGÇÖt finish it. (Admittedly it wasnGÇÖt very photogenic). | I recently visited this mexican place which is just opposite to hyde hotel in eyre square, near an pucan bar and undoubtedly it turned out good I mean so good!! =ƒÿì You should definitely go here if you wnat to try burritos this is the bets in town the flavours in each bite, blended so well and comes out so good.  What we had in the burrito - mexican rice - chicken meat - cheese - smokey chipotle pinto beans - charred corn And mild sauce on top.  Well we also tried some oreo churros, so if you have a sweet tooth for churros def try this out. G¥ñn+Å  Location- 4.8/5 Service- 5/5  DonGÇÖt forget to give a thumbs up if you like the review=ƒÆò | This place I used to visit regularly has gone downhill. The floor was dirty, with bits of food on it. The fridge where they keep the soft drinks doesnGÇÖt get cold, so you end up with any drink at room temperature, and to make things worse, they donGÇÖt provide ice to cool your drink. The burgers are good and the burritos too, but unfortunately the onion rings they served us were burnt. Another sign of this decline is that theyGÇÖve removed all the sauces and condiments from the tables, making the experience a poor one. There are better places in Galway now to have a burger. Come on, guys, get it together. | The food is fine for fast Tex mex, but the prices are so misleading. It costs extra for a vegetarian option. I asked for a veggie bowl and got lettuce. What was listed as Gé¼9.50 on the menu ended up costing me Gé¼16.50. Would not recommend to anyone on a budget | I absolutely lovee vocho, itGÇÖs my go to takeaway the food is always so tasty. But one thing is that every time I order it something is always missing or wrong :(  nonetheless it never stops me ordering it, but it is a shame. Especially because itGÇÖs a reoccurring theme with them.
Munch Haven is a Mexican restaurant in Galway. Customer reviews say: Ordered via UberEats and food arrived hot. The wings were flavourful & crispy on bed of seasoned chips. Margarita was 10/10 impressed with food & service. Will definitely order again. | Class chicken! Boneless is really crispy and tasty. Also the guys working in there are sound!! Highly recommended if youGÇÖre hungry after a night out or after work! | I hardly do any reviews but for this food place I really have to compliment nothing but the taste of food was spectacular and extremely delicious. I had pizza, boneless chicken and chicken wings and all of them were brilliant taste. Thanks to all the crew and keep the good work up guys. | Tried the chicken wings with chips several times during our Galway visit, and they were incredible!!! Best chicken I have ever had!!! (Best than KFC and korean friend chicken=ƒÿâ) freshly cooked, tender, juicy, and perfectly crispy!!! The quality, flavours, and sauces are unreal=ƒ½á Prices are affordable too. From the outside it looks like a regular kebab shop, but itGÇÖs so much more. Highly recommended!!!! | Food was super delicious, loved the spice box! All halal. Service was great, Haziq and his team were wonderful, super friendly lads Gÿ¦n+Å
Taquila is a Mexican restaurant in Galway. Customer reviews say: Great experience, it tastes like authentic Mexico! We had an amazing lunch. The chilaquiles and tacos were delicious. Excellent service and atmosphere. We will definitely be back. Thank you Gÿ¦n+Å | The nicest Mexican IGÇÖve had in Ireland hands down. Everything was absolutely delicious and full of flavour. Authentic Mexican food and generous portion sizes. The spicy margarita was tasty and strong. Excellent service. Cannot recommend this place enough!! | We had a delicious meal this evening at Taquila, the range was excellent and the portion sizes perfect. I will definitely return the next time I'm in Galway and highly recommend. | Absolutely the best Mexican food IGÇÖve had in Ireland! The flavours were incredible, IGÇÖve been dreaming about the tacos ever since. The nachos were also delicious, and everything tasted so fresh. They have a great selection of cocktails, including non-alcoholic options, which is perfect if you're driving.  The staff were super friendly and made the whole experience even better. I can't recommend this place enough. If youGÇÖre visiting Galway, Taquilia is a must visit spot. Plus, they do 2-for-1 tacos on Tuesdays, so you can try them all!  IGÇÖll definitely be back. =ƒî«G£¿ | Absolutely fantastic! Wow Tara was so lovely & detailing all the food for some of our novices =ƒñúG¥ñn+Å=ƒ¬¡
Sangria Tapas Restaurant is a Mexican restaurant in Galway. Customer reviews say: It's the place with the vibe. The restaurant is neither small nor very bigGÇösomewhere in the middle. When it's fully packed, it can get slightly noisy, but that's not a complaint. Quite the opposite, in fact. The blend of Latin American music, great interior design, and lively buzz comes together perfectly, especially after ordering a Mojito (or whichever drink you prefer) while waiting for your food.  The dishes and tapas are absolutely delicious =ƒññ. If you or your group enjoy sharing and trying different foods, this is heaven. We ordered two meat tapas and three seafood tapas. The meat dishes were fantastic, but the seafood tapas were on an entirely different level.  It was probably the first time I had seafood, like octopus =ƒÉÖ, paired with spicesGÇöand the combination worked so well. | Great experience here, the food was fantastic and the vibe is very good. Great music playing while you eat great food! The elote (crazy corn) and stuffed jalape+¦os are an absolute must get, 10/10s!!! | **GÿàGÿàGÿàGÿàGÿà Love this place GÇô book ahead!**  Sangria is my go-to when I fancy proper tapas in Galway. The food is so good GÇô think crispy patatas bravas, Portions are small (as they should be for tapas!), so order at least 2 plates per person It gets packed at dinner, especially on weekends GÇô IGÇÖve made the mistake of walking in without a booking and ended up waiting agesn+îNow I always reserve a table.  The vibe is super chill, staff are lovely (and patient when I take ages to decide), and itGÇÖs just the right mix of lively but not too loud. Already planning my next visit | This restaurant has been on my list since I came here. And I still cannot get over it, itGÇÖs so goodG¥ñn+Å I only had tres leaches, it was little sweet as per my taste but maybe the cuisine it comes under it is served that way.  All latin vibes bringing the cool vibes and stuff. Just wholesome=ƒñ¬ | Excellent food and impeccable service. First time having a Guatemalan inspired Tapas and will highly recommend to anyone visiting Galway. Their dessert sharing platter leaves no excuse for not trying!
Zambrero Headford Road is a Mexican restaurant in Galway. Customer reviews say: Really Enjoyed a quick bite here. Amanda served us and she made sure to help us through putting our tasty burritos together! I especially enjoyed the chipotle chicken with pinto beans. Would definitely revisit the place. | Small portions, served by "couldn't care less" servers. If you want a nice tasty burrito, with good service, travel to the Zambrero opposite the hospital. We usually do, but made a big mistake eating here. | Delicious food! Burritos are satisfying tasty and make a perfect lunch! =ƒî»G¥ñn+Å | Just would not let me buy an extra tortilla on the side even when I said I'll pay whatever he charges me for it, but he refused to let me make my own burrito at home he said he can either give me a burrito or a bowl and no matter what I can't get a tortilla on the side. But also very disappointed in how small the portions are, that and the service I got put together kinda overpowered the feelings i have about the taste of the food cause it does taste very nice. Please let people buy tortilla from you especially if they're okay paying for it. But from now I'll just stick to boojum | Best burrito I've ever had, server was friendly and made them quick
Deli La Tasca is a Mexican restaurant in Galway. Customer reviews say: Delicioso! Love a good tapas and this was great. Everything was awesome but the pork cheeks with port wine and mushrooms was incredible. Very cozy indoor space with outdoor seating as well (they close off the street to car traffic around 6:00pm, itGÇÖs awesome). We showed up without reservations at around 6:30 (on a Sat.) so we got seated and served very quickly, but definitely make reservations if eating at a more Spanish dinner time | Good food and wine selection. Nice cozy atmosphere and friendly staff. Wonderful experience | Nice Spanish restaurant in the Galway city center. Loved the atmosphere. We ordered a mixed starters plate to share, which was a great option and main course afterwards. Food was delicious, as well as the drinks but the portions was rather limited. We enjoyed our dinner anyways! Would recommend! | One of my favourite restaurants in Galway! David is really friendly and his staff are great. The food is delicious. The atmosphere is perfect if you are looking for authentic Spanish food and atmosphere. | One of the nicer Spanish tapas places in Galway. Very nice small plates , but generous for the price. Tasty wines at reasonable prices
Roosters Piri Piri is a Mexican restaurant in Limerick. Customer reviews say: Location in a petrol station but have to say, was pretty impressed after going to the actual full restaurants, itGÇÖs pretty much the same experience. Food was pretty fast and nice! Always consistent food with Roosters, recommend to all. | It's a restaurant in a Centra/Petrol station. Tables available indoors and outdoors but not only for the restaurant. Food was delicious and tasty. Chiken breast, medium chilli, sweet potato chips. | They seem to change their chicken burger recipe every time I eat here. I order "extra hot" it maybe was hot once. Now I ordered again today and was barely spicy or had any sauce on it just mayonnaise. The flavor even when not "extra hot" used to be so good so I didn't care! Found the chicken a bit dry and just bland flavor this time. Disappointed. They also don't offer delivery and you can't ring in and pay cash you have to pay by card. | 10/10 service & food. Great value & staff make you feel at home! No better place to get a lunch time offer=ƒÿü | For halal eaters, this is a really nice place. Food is super fresh and flavorful. Highly recommended!
Republic of Grill is a Mexican restaurant in Limerick. Customer reviews say: First experience in a Mexican place ,so I didnGÇÖt know what to expect or what to order.I was recommended Cochinita PilbilGÇª Not a great option,I should have went for beef tacos.. Food was cold,the meat,or maybe thatGÇÖsthe way should be served,fair enough. Nice seasoning and nice fresh coriander. I like the taste! But the amount of onion,Jesus! I will attach a picture. Maybe thatGÇÖs how it should be,but to be honest I would have preferred more tomatoes and less onion! The pickled onion was nice and also the mango sauce OMG!!!!!! Devine! Prices are good! I will try one more time!maybe I didnGÇÖt choose the right dish Gÿ¦n+ÅGÿ¦n+ÅGÿ¦n+Å=ƒñ¬ | Lovely tacos. Had the Mexican beef and Birria tacos. Lots of seating. | The food at the recent night in Oahu was out of this world. We had the corn the peppers dipped in cheese to start. Both were so tasty =ƒññ. Then the fish tacos and birria tacos. Wow amazing. The fish tacos were my favourite. Cocktails were also amazing. The white sangria and margarita especially. | Last time I had such good birria tacos in Queens in New York. Greasy, dirty, full of flavour, absolutely amazing =ƒÆ¬ | This was my first time trying Mexican tacos at Republic of Grill, and they were absolutely delicious. They offer different flavors to choose from, but I especially enjoyed the spicy ones. The customer service is greatGÇövery friendly and professional which makes the experience even better. The atmosphere is welcoming with great vibes. It can get a little crowded at times because itGÇÖs popular, and while the prices are on the higher side, the quality and overall experience make it worth it. Definitely recommend!
MELODY is a Mexican restaurant in Limerick. Customer reviews say: Myself and my husband went here the other night, despite been a quite night the atmosphere was still lovely with the music choice and great sounds system. The service was amazing and the food was incredible - highlights on the food were definitely the braised beef and the chorizo and cheese dish. We also shared the sangria which was amazing. Fantastic place highly recommend, will definitely be back. | We stayed in the beautiful town of Limerick for four days. This was my favorite restaurant experience. The food was wonderful but the service was also excellent. | It was a really amazing night! The owner is phantastic and everyone was really professional and welcoming. We are on our honeymoon they made our night special. Food was excellent! It is a place to go for great memories and auper food! | Cannot recommend here enough. It was our first time here, coming for a birthday dinner and the staff went above and beyond. The selection on the menu was amazing, with every single dish delivering on expectations. Such a beautiful spot, with beautiful Limerick people behind it, already planning my next visit back. | good vibe n good service but tbh the food wasnGÇÖt tasty like the review, nice to try and good vibe date with friends but just donGÇÖt bring much expectation for the food. Plus be careful order the garlic mushroom when u have date =ƒñú
Shake Dog Childers Road is a Mexican restaurant in Limerick. Customer reviews say: OMG, what a wonderful addition to the retail park! Spoiled for choice with the extensive menu. The decor, layout, ambiance are amazing! There's even a children's play area! My breakfast was superb, cooked exactly as ordered and fantastic value for money! The staff are so helpful and friendly! I will be back....it will be worth the 40 minute drive just to eat here!!!!! | We had the pleasure of having a lovely meal in Shake Dog this afternoon. Food was amazing. Service was excellent and I must praise the lovely young staff that looked after us. They made us feel welcome, the young lady went through the menu with us and the options we could have. Checked on us while we were eating. There was no problem when we had to split the bill. Nothing was a hastle. The young man working there opened the door for elderly customers when leaving and chatted with them. A well brought up young man. When we were leaving, he treated us with the same respect, opening the door and wishing us a safe journey. I think we were all blown away as this is very rare to see and experience. I hope your employer appreciates the experience ye are giving to customers. Well done | Lovely lunch today. Server was friendly and chatty. Place was clean and service was great. Defo recommend the hot wings.... there so hot but tasty | This Shake Dog branch offers excellent food and great value with their 3-in-1 deals. We got the protein burger for an extra Gé¼2, absolutely worth it. The Nutella milkshake was brilliant, and the food was fresh with a wide selection on the menu to choose from. The staff were very helpful and even modified the dish due to an allergy. Plenty of free parking available too. Highly recommended! =ƒìö =ƒìƒ=ƒì¦ | After seeing 4,5 * in rating I was expecting bit more. Just fast food with overfried onion rings and chicken wings. Staff is nice. Won't be complaining
The Good Room Caf+¬ is a Mexican restaurant in Limerick. Customer reviews say: I visited The Good Room Caf+¬ in Adare, Limerick, last month during my trip, and it was a delightful experience. I stopped in for lunch and ordered the chicken burger with a side of potatoes and salad. The burger was tasty and well-prepared, with a nice balance of flavors.  Afterward, I decided to indulge in a cappuccino and cake. The coffee was excellent, but the real highlight was the spiced carrot cake. It was simply delicious, with the perfect blend of spices. The spiced carrot cake was particularly memorable. Highly recommend this cozy spot for a satisfying meal and a great coffee break!  The cozy ambiance and friendly service made the experience even better. I highly recommend The Good Room Caf+¬ to anyone passing through AdareGÇöitGÇÖs a gem you shouldnGÇÖt miss! | We arrived here by chance and we had the best lunch we could have imagined! The service was great, weather was nice and we enjoyed three dishes, the hummus with poached eggs, some toast with goat cheese and a chicken wrap. I'm not exaggerating when I say we had probably one of our best meals ever =ƒÿï=ƒÿï flavours were just so good. I'd come back a thousand times!! | Lovely cafe we stopped in to take a break during our drive to Killarney.  The staff was so hospitable and kind, the pastries and coffee were delicious.  Outdoor seating was very scenic.  Cozy spot to stop at. | The food was delicious, goats cheese french toast was so good! Full Irish also a big hit! Good coffee, attentive staff, a very busy spot but understandable! | WeGÇÖre tourists and this was the most delicious breakfast weGÇÖve had in Ireland! Perfect place to catch up with friends or to have a cozy brunch with family or by yourself. Service was lovely and they have a wide variety of bread. You must try their vanilla matcha!
Zambrero Castletroy is a Mexican restaurant in Limerick. Customer reviews say: Online menu says nachos and quesadilla are gluten free but staff said they are not. Staff are very slow and seem unsure as to what is available, atleast 8 people left the queue in the space of 25 mins while we waited. The hygiene standards are low, the server took off her gloves to take my bag of chips out of a big bag under the counter! Tacos are taken straight out of Old El Paso taco boxes. Burrito bowl was grand but was Gé¼14.90 and way smaller than Boojum. | I very rarely add negative reviews, but today really got me. We came in 40mins before closing and ordered food takeaway, the food itself wasn't bad but the service was terrible, especially one young lady, very negative energy gave me half a portion in comparison to my friend who ordered the same thing but was served by a much nicer older gentleman. When I asked her if she could add a bit more meat she refused and told me that it would be extra charge, no thank you, no smile, very negative... | Ordered 2 burritos, one arrived cold. Both were completely tasteless.  Also ordered guacamole which was also tasteless - takes some skills to make Mexican food bland but they managed!  Avoid! | Ordered online and food was bland, not worth it in my opinion. We couldnGÇÖt finish our burritos, very disappointing | Went there with my friends ,the staff were so rude atmosphere was not it. I Will not come back. Staff needs a lesson on customer service.
Texas Steakout is a Mexican restaurant in Limerick. Customer reviews say: It was a great feel and the food was just like back home! Even the bourbon BBQ sauce for the bourbon burger. I got a 10oz ribeye medium and it was cooked perfectly to temp. I asked for  a sear and they didnGÇÖt get that part thought. We also had the kids ribs. My 8yo was sad it only came with 2 ribs. We got the sampler as a meal plate and split it.  The only thing lacking was service. We are water drinkers and couldnGÇÖt get them to keep our water full. We had to ask several times for each refill. It didnGÇÖt make sense.  One of the waitresses was also snippy with me. Maybe it was just a long day but it was off putting. Service was a 3/5.  WeGÇÖd definitely go back for some Texas food! | Food was good but if you're from the South [US] don't expect it to actually be tex-mex/Texan. It wasn't bad but it just wasn't what I expected. Food wasn't spicy even the stuff listed as spicy, flavors a bit bland, but nothing bad. The guac was a dud. We were put in a nook and kinda forgotten about (relatively normal for Ireland servers). It was overall a good experience though. Our last stop before and am flight. Sept 17, 2024. | Had a lovely romantic meal here with my husband. I had a delicious veggie stir fry and was pleasantly surprised to see more than one option for vegan food at a steak house. I also joyously drunk a No Alcohol Frozen Margarita that just perfected the night. | Food was amazing.. atmosphere was fab we loved the decor.  Only negative we would have had was that as we were midway through eating starters staff leaned infront of us to lay cutlery for main course. Usually this is done when starters are cleared not as ur eating. | First impressions: My Girlfriend and I had dinner in Texas Steakout on Jan 1st whilst staying at a nearby Hotel. The restaurant is well presented, spacious and a nice atmosphere. Upon arriving there are a flight of stairs down to the restaurant, I imagine making it difficult for wheelchair users to attend.  Service: I called to make a reservation, imagining on new years day it would be busy. I was offered 20:00 on the phone however managed to secure a 19:30 booking using the open table app. Upon arrival we were greeted promptly and shown to our table which was ready for us. Once sat, we were offered the drinks menu and given a bottle of water for the table. Service, food and drink delivery was very prompt - Almost a little too prompt as it did not really allow for any kind of settling before the next course arrived.  Food: Drink: We both opted for a pornstar martini which arrived as you expect, garnished with a passionfruit. It was a good cocktail. Starters: For starter we had the loaded potato skins and the garlic mushrooms, both were nicely presented and a suitably sized portion. Both tasted great and would recommend to anyone  attending. Mains: For main course both my girlfriend and myself opted for the beef and chicken fajitas. These were exactly as you expect, severed on a sizzle platter and a generous amount. As with most fajita dishes in restaurants the accompaniments felt a little disproportionate to the meat, however well filled wraps ensure that the three supplied tortillas can be enough, with a little left over, If I was to suggest improvements I would suggest possibly 1 more tortilla and a little larger portion of sauces to ensure there is enough for the amount of filling you receive. Deserts: For desert we opted for the strawberry Eton mess and the chocolate chip cookie jar. Both were great deserts and a suitably sized portion for a third course. Both were presented well, however the "cookie jar" wasn't what you expect with it being served in a glass "bowl" rather than a jar, however this did not take away from it being a nice desert.  Atmosphere: on New years day evening the restaurant was busy however not at capacity. there was a good amount of space between tables a noise level that allowed for easy talking witho
No. 1 Pery Square Hotel & Spa is a Mexican restaurant in Limerick. Customer reviews say: We were on a GÇÿwalkaboutGÇÖ in Limerick, it was my partnerGÇÖs birthday weekend and we wanted some casual lunch and a bottle of something bubbly to celebrate. Having attended a wonderful wedding at No 1 Pery Square we decided to revisit.  ItGÇÖs a quirky luxury boutique kinda feel when you enter into the pink and green interior festooned with everlasting floral arrangements, panelled walls and contemporary furniture.  We settled in the bar with the groups of ladies on brunch and residents from the hotel getting GÇÿtucked inGÇÖ to the cocktail list.  The friendly and sartorial team looked after us with aplomb. We were recommended and  enjoyed a bottle of the pink Cremant Gé¼58 - very good value and delicious.  Beetroot Gravlax with citrus, small cubes of cucumber jelly served with stout bread, tomato soup and home made fat chipsGÇª YUM - Who doesnGÇÖt like a GÇÿpickyGÇÖ lunch with chips and bubbles? Demolished in no time!  There is more substantial plates upon the menu and what looked like a delightful afternoon tea being served around us and quite possibly at some point we will be back to partake.  A very nice afternoon was spent plus we dodged the rainGÇª Total win win.  Lovely | No. 1 Pery Square is an unexpected gem in Limerick!  The style and design are truly incomparable and meticulous. We loved the unique, luxurious detailsGÇöfrom the comforting scents throughout to the quirky garden art featuring vintage motors and machines. Service is impeccable, the spa was pristine, and the food and drink were superb.  A genuinely relaxing, high-quality experience. Highly recommend! | Absolutely incredible experience, the staff were so friendly and welcoming. We had treatments in the spa and it was the best massage IGÇÖve ever had! Beautiful relaxing atmosphere throughout the whole hotel | Our stay at 1 Pery Square was absolutely remarkable.  Damien was incredibly kind throughout our visit and made us feel genuinely welcomed from the moment we arrived.  It was truly one of the nicest experiences weGÇÖve ever had. The room was beautiful, the food was exceptional and the spa was just incredible. An absolutely outstanding experience in every way and looking forward to returning. Thank you =ƒÖÅ | Unfortunately my experience was not positive. I booked a room and reserved a table in restaurant for Friday Jan 2nd. Plans changed and when I received an email to confirm my reservation I cancelled; received email confirmation of cancellation and believed all was cancelled.  On Saturday Jan 3rd, I received an email notifying that as I had not cancelled the previous night I was liable for room charge. I sent a copy of email confirming cancellation only to be told this was for restaurant only and not room.  I received no email regarding my room booking close to arrival date or call on Jan 2nd to confirm my booking or arrival time. I genuinely believed room reservation was cancelled and advised hotel of same.  I telephoned to explain that I believed all was cancelled and offered to leave full value of booking as a credit with hotel to rebook at a later date. They were pleasant but wanted payment for room on Jan 2nd. After some discussion I agreed to pay 112 euros for a room I didn't occupy.  On Monday Jan 5th, I received an email thanking me forJan 2nd booking & hoped I was well rested & enjoyed my stay and requested feedback Very annoyed that hotel can send automated emails for reviews but no reminders for booking.  Emailed hotel with feedback, acknowledged my email but no positive outcome.  Very expensive cost on New Years weekend.
Marco Polo is a Mexican restaurant in Limerick. Customer reviews say: Great spot, all the food was excellent. Kids eat for free on a Sunday too which is brilliant. We had the calamari, ribs, Chinese curry and Singapore noodles, all excellent. Good choice on the kids menu, even had a kids smash burger.  The robot server that brings the food is cool too =ƒÿé staff were very nice and left you be. Also, the food came really quickly and it was pretty busy there. Couldn't fault the place, booking was easy too. Rang the day before and had an instant confirmation text on my phone. | I donGÇÖt recommend getting GÇ£sharing platterGÇ¥ for started, the amount and quality of food is ridiculous for the price of 28 euro. The mains were great though, lovely food, except the fact that you have to order side like potato or chips separately. Service is average, overall experience is average IGÇÖd say, nothing really stands out about this place. | Had a lovely meal for my wife's birthday. She really enjoyed the prawns and chorizo and I loved the sticky asian chicken. The affogato was delicious. Good service and will return. | Very nice staff and the food is just incredible! We've came here many times and will definitely be back in the future. Well done Marcopolo =ƒæÅ | We have a family night out each Christmas and, for the second year in a row, went to Marco Polo. Lovely food, atmosphere and the staff were excellent =ƒÆ»
Zambrero Thomas Street is a Mexican restaurant in Limerick. Customer reviews say: Amazing food, amazing staff!! Great vibe in the restaurant! Best place for burrito in Limerick by far... Place is spotless as well | As someone who regularly ordered from castletroys store , my expectations were high for the new store on Thomas street. The store has exceeded my expectations. The service is fast, the staff are extremely friendly , the music is great and the new kiosk system makes ordering much easier. The food is fresh and tasty , and I will most certainly be ordering from here again! | Probably the best burrito in town. The sauce options are amazing, especially the red sauce and verde sauce. The spice level is just right for me, and the red sauce even has a subtle peach note. Portions are solid as well.  Forgot to take photo of their burrito tho! | First time ordering from here after hearing a lot about it. I know there are two chains and this one is newer, but honestly, if youGÇÖre going to do Mexican food, you need to do it properly.  If youGÇÖre going to open a place and charge restaurant prices, then do the food properly. Being a new business isnGÇÖt an excuse for missing ingredients or poor assembly. ItGÇÖs very frustrating there is not one good Mexican restaurant around Limerick City bar Republic Grill, even though there not the best either but nothing has topped them yet in my opinion. I would have been better off to order boojum.  I ordered a burrito bowl and a lot of what I requested was missing. There were literally two jalape+¦os, so I had to add my own. The bowl itself was alright, but missing key ingredients, no beans at all, very little sour cream, and the avocado was hidden underneath everything and used very sparingly for the price. I also had to add my own cheese and jalape+¦os, which defeats the whole point of ordering out.  I like my food hot, so I had to reheat it but once you heat lettuce, itGÇÖs not nice. ThatGÇÖs on me for choosing lettuce, but itGÇÖs something I wouldnGÇÖt get again.  The dos tacos were nothing special and werenGÇÖt prepared properly at all. They were lopsided, poorly assembled, and arrived cold. Cold tacos just donGÇÖt taste good, full stop. The shell and tortilla just tasted like kitchen roll, and the meat was just as bad.  For a restaurant order that costs a small fortune, I expect to get what I asked for and for the food to be well prepared and enjoyable. I could genuinely make better Mexican food at home and open up my own food chain. That shouldnGÇÖt be the case when ordering from a restaurant. If this is how food is going out the door, then changes seriously need to be made. New business or not, customers arenGÇÖt test dummies. If youGÇÖre asking people to spend their money here, the bare minimum is that the food is hot, complete, and actually resembles what was ordered. Very disappointing | I ordered some tacos and was buzzing to try the GÇÿrealGÇÖ Mexican flavour they claim to offer. They looked decent, but it turned out to be absolute bullshit. A shitty imitation with an industrial, mass-produced taste and none of that proper homemade Mexican touch. The tortillas were disgusting, rubbery as hell, and honestly hard to chew. Total disappointment. I had high expectations, but after thisGÇª NEVER. AGAIN =ƒ½ñ
Locke Burger Castletroy is a Mexican restaurant in Limerick. Customer reviews say: It's a normal burger place, with high quality and great food! The service was good but with a lack of flexibility and bother line rudeness at the end of the night due to the insistence of not allowing to do a split of check for a group. It is a relatively economic place to dinne and I do recommend to visit it at least once! The ambience is very nice although a little bit too dark, maybe they are waiting to change all of the bulbs as a group. | Pretty good burger and chips. I got the fried chicken burger, which was gorgeous, and the bacon cheese and ranch fries. They had a little too much ranch for me. Got the Mozzarella sticks as a starter, and oh my god, the cheese pull was top-notch. The strawberry daiquiri was nice.  The place was somewhat clean we found an old sauce package on our table which made us question if the table was really clean however the toilets were very clean.  Overall, it was a really nice place for a little bite. | Amazing!!!!  I visited here recently and what a fabulous visit.  I was seated on arrival and served very quickly - were ordered two burgers and they were gorgeous, the bacon ranch fries were 10/10.  The churros were divine and perfect to share, the millshakes also gorgeous.  All in all a lovely casual meal and great value! | Really flavoursome veggie "Impossible" burger. It was full of flavour and possibly the nicest burger for a vegetarian/vegan. The fries with Frank's hot sauce were nice but there was too much hot sauce added. A small bit of hot sauce and more of the cheddar cheese and garlic sauce would be a lot better. It was swimming in it. Overall I'll definitely be back again. | We went for an early lunch on Christmas Eve and it was very quiet. Staff were lovely and very attentive. Food was lovely and arrived quickly. Would recommend
Coqbull Limerick is a Mexican restaurant in Limerick. Customer reviews say: Service was great, food is not what IGÇÖm used to from CoqBull. Got the 1/2 roast chicken option for Gé¼21, which came with a frankly tiny amount of potato and stuffing and nothing else. Would be much less of an affront to the wallet if they could even add a couple of vegetables or some more potato - as it is, feels like a complete rip off. | Such a nice place: tasty and affordable food, extremely nice service, clean bathrooms. We would like to praise the professionalism of your waitress Holly! High recommended! | Amazing quality of service. All the servers in this building are some of the most accommodating, sweetest and quick servers ive had the pleasure of being served by. Now to start on the food, these burgers were some of the juiciest, most tender burgers ive ever had. The nashville chicken burger was astonishingly good I would recommend, the chicken was juicy and fell apart in my mouth, the breading on the chicken was seasoned to perfection, the perfect amount of hot honey sauce that complimented the chicken incredibly well- not too sweet and not too hot, perfect. Sensational. Would come back again. The dragonfruit diva is a drink I would recommend to ALL of you reading this. This cocktail was absolutely beautiful AND refreshing and as someone with a peach allergy, they had zero problems accommodating that for me. This restaurant has the perfect portions for their desserts too. The dirty cookie is the best thing ive ever put in my mouth to explain it plainly. The atmosphere was warm, cozy and perfect. With beautiful music playing at the perfect volume to speak over. Will 10000000% be coming back. | It all started with a simple phone call & led to an amazing overall experience with the staff, food & all! I wondered about the foods ingredients, specifically, the gluten or lactose free menu.  I was greeted by a manager or supervisor named Emma over my call, so polite, down to earth yet very professional. She resolved all my queries in relation to the kiddies strick diet they have almost instantly, all I was left with was excitement for the kiddies reaction when I told them what they could order and as for their faces when eating.. lol. Very happy!  The food service and food that followed was of the best experiences I had with the flavor, cooked to perfection, portions full and of course, the service from all staff who played their part was top notch.  We were recharged. After a long week of work and moving house, I'd highly recommend this restaurant in Limerick city and to you Emma and staff, well done & thank you all! G¥ñn+ÅG£¿ | G¡Én+ÅG¡Én+ÅG¡Én+Å-á3 stars Our visit to Coqbull Limerick today was disappointing in several key areas. Upon being seated, we were placed at a table that had visible dirt on it. Instead of cleaning it, napkins and cutlery were laid down straight away. This was unacceptable, particularly given that several other clean tables were available and remained free throughout our visit. Menus were handed to us without any explanation of the Christmas menu or the Sunday roast. Customer service from the waiting staff was essentially non-existent from this point onward, as there was little engagement beyond taking the order. When ordering drinks, we requested a jug of water. It did not arrive. We later requested a jug of water again, and while one was eventually brought to the table, it came without glasses. We ordered two burgers. The buns were noticeably very cold, as though they had been refrigerated, which detracted from the quality of the meal. One burger was ordered with fries as a side, advertised at Gé¼4.50, but we were charged Gé¼5.50 instead. No one checked on us during the meal to ask how everything was or whether we needed anything further. The burgers themselves were average and unremarkable, with no standout flavours or elements. The restaurant is nicely decorated for Christmas, which adds to the atmosphere, but overall
The Hungry Lyons Dooradoyle is a Mexican restaurant in Limerick. Customer reviews say: The food was absolutely fantasticGÇöfreshly prepared and bursting with flavor! The burger was exceptionally delicious, generously packed with fresh salad, and incredibly satisfying.  The staff were outstandingGÇöwarm, welcoming, and truly went above and beyond to deliver top-notch service.  The ice cream was another highlightGÇörich, creamy, and served in generous portions that made for the perfect treat.  While the prices are on the higher side, the quality, portion sizes, and overall experience make it well worth every penny. Highly recommended! | This is the measly portion of dry cold fries you get with your Gé¼12.50 meal form hungry lions. Barely any sauce on the burger also. What a rip. Stick to Supermacs. | When you pay over 12 euro for a "Meal" and get these refried chips its not good enough. Couldn't finish the chips as they were greasy/oily. Trying to support locals but I'd have been better off going to Supermacs. Not worth the money. | Food is consistenly good, prices are reasonable. However, management and staff attitudes are poor. Cash is very much looked down upon. Tills all have signs saying that they are closed and to use the kiosks. Staff will begin by asking you (after leaving you standing there for a minute or two)  if you are paying cash or card, if you say card, they'll ask you to use the kiosk, if you are paying cash, they'll walk away and leave you wait a few more minutes. It's really disappointing to see a business that clearly sees cash paying customers as a burden to them. I understand that it may be more convenient for you to do business using cards, but at the end of the day, it just shows a sense of laziness, and is no excuse. In general, staff taking orders can be fairly rude and don't seem to pay too much care towards their work. While the food is always good, some serious work is needed on staff training and management attitude towards paying customers. | Have to say the nicest Chicken fillet burger I have had in a very long time, so tender with just the right amount of sauce lettuce, etc, and the secret gravy is well worth a try.
House Limerick is a Mexican restaurant in Limerick. Customer reviews say: I visited this place and spoke with Damie, the manager. Even though there were many open tables, I was told they were all reserved. ItGÇÖs very frustrating to see so much space available but not be able to sit down.  When I asked about the waiting time, I was only told that it GÇ£depends,GÇ¥ without a clear answer. We were a group of nine, just looking to enjoy some drinks together, but it wasnGÇÖt possible. It would be great if the place could better accommodate groups who want to come, relax, and have a good time. | From the moment we walked in, we were greeted with warm smiles and genuine hospitality. The floor manager made us feel incredibly welcome, setting the tone for a fantastic lunch with river wiev. The staff were extremely friendly and attentive without being overbearing.The food? Absolutely amazing! Duck wrap and steak sandwich full of flavor, beautifully presented, and clearly made with care. The ambience was super cosy perfect for a relaxing. The lighting, decor, and overall vibe made it feel like a home away from home. Highly recommended ! we'll definitely be back | Great atmosphere! The Cocktails are excellent. Ideal for a date or a night out with the girls! | Prawn pilpil and duck Salad were both amazing. Staff were very helpful and friendly. Great Atmosphere too considering it was mid week | Food is always good. This is one of my go to place that doesnGÇÖt disappoint - breakfast, lunch, dinner.  I find this on the pricey side but oh well food flavor and presentation wise =ƒÿï=ƒæî
Maggie Choo's is a Mexican restaurant in Limerick. Customer reviews say: Good food and service. I was in for Sunday brunch. Pity about bad reviews re bouncers. Puts off the public from trying out their good food. | Nice place, good music, plenty of different areas to sit or have drinks. Good was surprisingly good, especially the Cesaers Salad. Drinks a bit overpriced but OK for the good location everything is coming with. | Had a great experience here. Got a tour of all the rooms, itGÇÖs MASSIVE! Gorgeously curated/decorated. Everything is so thoughtful and intentional. Beautiful location. Variety of themed rooms. I was told they do a gin cocktail class. I believe Gé¼35/pp or so. IGÇÖm totally doing it next time! Just call ahead. Had a drink and appetizer. Service was good as were the drinks and food. | Beautiful place, good music, an excellent ambient. The waiter was super attentive during the service. Hostess super friendly, the burger was delicious. Just my fries were a little bit overcooked but in general everything good. Happy to know this place G£¿ | I enjoyed lunch at Maggie Choo's and had a great experience. The setting is very modern with a cosy feel. The menu features a nice array of dishes. I tried the veggie burger and two cocktails, both delicious. The service was excellentGÇöfriendly and attentive without being intrusive. Overall, Maggie Choo's is a memorable place for lunch or special occasions. I look forward to going back!
Sambros is a Mexican restaurant in Limerick. Customer reviews say: Live the atmosphere, service and food in the place!  I ate the Flaming Lane (sans fill pickle slaw =ƒºÉ) and it melts in your mouth and providers a kick that makes you smile!  Definitely a repeatable customer here!  =ƒì¦tj | The best tacos IGÇÖve ever had, really authentic and delicious. Also got one of their burgers and the quality is unbelievable, definitely recommend for a bite to eat. | Ordered food from here for the first time last night on just eat, at 6:46pm waited an hour and still no sign of the food, checked app, food was still being prepared. Waited another 10 min, still no change, food not even marked out for delivery on the app. Rang them up and guy on the phone told me they didn't have a delivery driver and then blamed justeat for allowing the option of delivery. He then told me not to worry as he had already made the food and that he was waiting for a delivery driver to arrive before he could send it out but he wasn't sure how long it would take.. I was not happy about this as the food would be freezing but apparently this wasn't his problem or fault, it was between me and justeat..  This guy kept calling me brother and kept talking to me like i was a fool? I'm not your brother, and don't talk to me like that. He then hung up on me because he said I was being "rude" to him and I must have hurt his feelings..  Eventually, a few minutes later he answered again and i told him i wanted a full refund and he said it was roo late because the food was on the way now. Bear in mind this was about 1.5 hours after the order. There's no way i was accepting this food but again he told me to ring justeat (which isnt possible).. Eventually he said he would cancel the order but i might not get my full money back as i had ordered food, the food was made and it was now on the way. Then he started saying i would get a full refund after all. I told him there were 2 options either i get my full refund or he would have serious problems. The full refund arrived back in my account less than an hour later..  So, my whole night was ruined but luckily enough for him, the refund came through or else his week would have been ruined.. Absolute disaster of a place, stay away.. Couldn't leave a review on justeat because you can't review cancelled orders. | Food here has always been outstanding but the tacos and next level. Best tacos IGÇÖve had in Ireland never mind Limerick. | 2 people in the restaurant, 25 minute wait for a sandwich. Very basic decor, hard benches. My 'sandwich' with a bread roll similar to a hotdog bun. Food was on a par with a supermarket deli. Was wanting to try this place for ages. So disappointed. Staff were nice and friendly.
The Locke Bar is a Mexican restaurant in Limerick. Customer reviews say: The Locke is a great spot to relax with a few drinks lovely atmosphere and a nice place to sit by the river.  The food, however, was just okay. For the prices they charge, I expected something a bit more refined.  I wouldnGÇÖt recommend the beef nachosGÇöthey tasted off, and the cheese had a sour flavor that was quite unpleasant.  The staff are nice, the girl that served us was so nice and happy to help with what ever we wanted.  The bar was very busy so it was quite difficult to try get served, no real structure to the queue. | We really enjoyed the hour we spent today on a wet, gray mid-September afternoon having a cuppa and a ham sandwich at the outside tables of Locke Bar. The tea was just as tea should be GÇö-ástrong enough to trot a mouse across it, as the Irish used to day. And the sandwiches were well-made and generous.  In addition, the young woman who greeted us inside at the bar and took our order couldn't have been nicer, and the woman who brought our tea and sandwiches to us was equally cordial and smiling. The interior of Locke Bar is classic pub, dark, lots of beautiful woodwork, gleaming spigots for dispensing Guiness and other beers. Altogether a first-rate pub in the heart of Limerick's old city. | Had a great meal at the Locke Bar last night. Servings are plentiful, I had the steak and ale pie. It was delicious. My partner had the special fish. It was cod with a spicy sauce, a salad and roast potatoes. Really flavoursome. Great selection of drinks, all the beers you could want. The atmosphere was excellent. Irish music and dancing. Good tip if you want to eat on a Saturday evening, go fairly early or make a booking. By 8 oGÇÖclock, the place is bulging. | This is a great spot to go for a local taste of Limerick. You can tell it's been around for a while and it's not too far from King John's Castle. We stopped in to get a small bite and found a cozy table inside. It's very pub-like but family friendly. The service was friendly and helped us to order since we were a little undecided. We ended up getting the Burata di Bufala, seafood chowder, and some chicken wings. Everything was about what you'd expect from a Sunday lunch menu at a pub. It didn't blow us away but it hit the spot and we got to soak in the Limerick atmosphere while we ate. I wish we could have come back in the evening to experience the more night-life version of this place because it seems very cool! Maybe we'll plan to do that next time we're in town. Sl+íinte! | Best fish and chips in ages! Light and crispy batter,  not great greasy all. My friend really enjoyed her steak and ale pie as well. Very filling. Our server Taylor was great,  very friendly and helped us get a taxi.
Boojum - Limerick is a Mexican restaurant in Limerick. Customer reviews say: Today, after a long trip and extremely hungry, we decided to order a take out from boojum in Limerick today 24/6 around 9pm. I asked for a burrito bowl with chorizo as a meat. When she opened the container, there is only few left (shown on the picture) and she shouted to her colleague for more chorizo. She decided to put the add ons while we are waiting for it. It is taking a while and I said that, if there is no more chorizo left at the back, I'll take chicken with it. From then she mentioned to me that she already put the chorizo. I replied and ask if it is really the portion size which she attitudely replied yes and moved on to a different customer. As we came from a very long trip, tired and non confrontational people, we decided to pay for it and it cost us 9 euro for this much food. 12 cubes of chorizo as protein. If the portion left is not enough, just say it directly so people can choose something else. It is embarrassing to charge people full price for this amount of food while other people received a decent amount of protein for almost the same price. I rarely write reviews but today's disappointing that it made me write one. | I ordered a too good to go bag. Lady manning the cash register asked if I had any allergies or preferences. I told her I have the soap gene so minimal cilantro please and she looked through the premade bags and couldn't find anything suitable. I also asked for a tortilla on the side.  I got a freshly dished bowl with a warm tortilla for 5 euro. Definitely coming back! The food is delicious and the customer service was second to none. | The Alt Pastor Tacos with Chipotle Sour Cream was the best and most flavourful vegan dish I've had at a fast food restaurant. It was actually spicy! I loved it.  The store was extremely busy so coming in prepared is recommended. | Very good service and very good food fresh good quality lots of choices. Only downfall is it is very cold to sit in the restaurant to eat your food. | Worst boojum IGÇÖve ever been to. Waited 20 minutes queuing with only 8 ppl in front of me. Burrito was dry and badly wrapped, tiny and stingy in ingredients , no guacamole on a Saturday avo at 5pm and hygiene of guy wrapping burritos was shocking. It was also freezing in the building. No pride or love in this franchise - a shame because I love all the other boojums.
Flanagan's on the Lake is a Mexican restaurant in Limerick. Customer reviews say: Whenever I visit during the summer, I always make sure to stop by FlanaganGÇÖs on the Lake in Ballina Quay, Tipperary, Ireland. It's such a lovely restaurant GÇö the food is always delicious, and the view of the lake makes the experience even more special. The staff are really nice and welcoming, which adds to the overall great experience.  I absolutely loved the salad GÇö fresh leafy greens with sweet roasted pecans, creamy goat cheese, beetroot, and their own in-house dressing. ItGÇÖs simple, but the flavors are so well balanced and refreshing. A real standout!  Another highlight was the garlic and cheese pizza with a gluten-free base. It was perfectly crispy and packed with flavor GÇö a real treat!  The roast beef was incredibly tender, served warm with a rich, flavorful sauce and perfectly cooked vegetables GÇö not overdone, just right.  And the desserts! The mango and yuku cream br++l+¬e was light and delicious. I also enjoyed the apple crumble served with custard, ice cream, and fresh fruits GÇö comforting and so satisfying.  Highly recommend this place if you're in the area GÇö great food, friendly staff, and a beautiful lakeside view! | Had a fantastic meal here. It was Monday evening and a lot of restaurants were closed. Was the best meal I had in Ireland this week.  Beautifully cooked steak and made even better by accommodating my request to swap mashed potatoes for stir fried peppers instead. The steak is marinated overnight according to our server. The Argentinian Malbec pairing was spot on. My wife had the pepperoni pizza (with extra pepperoni topping) which was also excellent. Service excellent 10/10. Asked waiter to pass on my compliments to the kitchen. | Saturday night, early evening, absolutely buzzing atmosphere. We got a table for 2 inside, but the outside tables were filling up fast. All serving guys and gals were excellent. They were attentive, efficient and friendly. Our orders were taken quickly and the drinks and starters arrived promptly. The food was Wow!! So delightfully tasty, well cooked and well presented. Prawns, duck and sea bass. All expertly cooked and accompanied by perfectly balanced potatoes and veg. A perfect evening. | Can always get a seat undercover outside in the summer. Food was good. Parking can be tricky nearby. Good views of the old bridge. Sports on TV . Table service. Teryaki Lamb was excellent with loads of wild mushrooms. Very tastey. The nachos dip was disappointing. Just chips with liquid cheese poured over. And 2 plastic tubs of dips. See photo. Might as well get a bag of cheese and onion instead and save Gé¼11. | Brilliant food and service today as usual. Portions are always very good and prices are standard. Always busy and despite this, youGÇÖre always served quickly. We had Sarah as our server and she was great. Fish dishes were unreal esp the tartar sauce and portions. IGÇÖve also had the vegitarian pasta and pizzas before which are great too. Thanks :)
Zambrero Ardkeen is a Mexican restaurant in Waterford. Customer reviews say: Regular burrito was very small. Wasn't worth the price. It's actually hard to imagine that there's a smaller version given how little the fillings are on the regular. Taste wise it was decent though. Staff were a bit all over the place which you'd expect on opening day. One guy was actually openly telling off another staff member for putting too much filling on another man's burrito and it had to be explained to him that the customer ordered a large not a regular. Wouldn't be too harsh given it's the first day but staff def didn't feel or look like they were comfortable. Black girl on the till was great though. Bubbly personality and pleasant to interact with. Wish them the best goin forward but unless they are a bit more generous with the fillings, it's impossible to justify the price. | My kids usually don't eat burritos and here they loved every bit and gobbled it whole in no time. My oldest kid said it's the best restaurant he's ever been to =ƒÿâ I love the signature burrito it's very filling and has a reasonable price. The only thing is that for 4 burritos and drinks &ice creams we paid over 60Gé¼ but at least you pay for a healthy and very filling food better then fast food. | Fantastic experience from start to finish. We were served by Emma, who couldn't have been more helpful and friendly. Excellent food & service. Spotlessly clean also! | Served by Brona. Lovely manner very friendly and made a lovely bowl. | Brona had great customer skills. SheGÇÖs very friendly and polite & worked at a fast pace. The food she served was lovely. Definitely becoming a regular here!!
Emiliano's Restaurant is a Mexican restaurant in Waterford. Customer reviews say: Fantastic restaurant! Food was amazing! The best truffle sauce any of us had tasted. A little pricier than normal but absolutely well worth it. Cocktails were also really good. | We had a great time here! The servers were great and took time to joke with our table. The ambience and setting is great - super cute and well thought out. The food was delicious! Highly recommend | Authentic Italian restaurant that serves delicious food. Love the decor and the staff is really nice. As a returning customer, I have tried many different dishes and everything was delicious. | This is the best of Italy in Waterford.  Superb restaurant.  Found my pizza of choice actually on the menu, first time ever. The Gorgonzola!!  DonGÇÖt miss it =ƒÿï | My partner and I recently celebrated his birthday at Emiliano's in Waterford, and the entire experience was nothing amazing. From the moment we walked in, the restaurant atmosphere felt warm, vibrant, and genuinely Italian. Exceptional Service is the Standard The staff at Emiliano's truly elevated our special evening. They were attentive, incredibly friendly, and went out of their way to ensure our celebration felt personal and memorable. Their service was seamless efficient without ever feeling rushed, making us feel completely looked after from start to finish. Big thanks to the team for making the birthday celebrations so wonderful! The food was the absolute highlight. Everything tasted incredibly fresh and authentic, showcasing true Italian passion. For starters, we enjoyed the Bruschetta perfectly toasted bread topped with fresh, vibrant tomatoes, mozzarella, and aromatic basil, and fresh Burrata on  delicious, soft fried dough, perfectly complemented by worm Mediterranean salad. For the main courses, we were equally impressed. The spaghetti fruit do mare was outstanding generously loaded with fresh monk fish, prawns, mussels, clams, and calamari in a rich, deeply flavored tomato sauce, pure comfort food executed flawlessly. We also had the rack of lamb which were cooked to perfection, tender, and juicy, served with a gorgeous, dark reduction sauce and perfectly prepared seasonal vegetables. Emiliano's isn't just a meal; it's an experience. If you are looking for delicious, high quality Italian food paired with warm, genuine, and professional service in Waterford, look no further. Whether it's a casual dinner or a special occasion like a birthday, Emiliano's is the perfect place. We highly recommend it and can't wait to return!
Power's Takeaway is a Mexican restaurant in Waterford. Customer reviews say: Delicious pizza, the Mexican one is unreal! =ƒññand lovely spuddy chips. Were very lucky to have this fantastic chipper in the village. | Takeaway in the village of Kill. I have included prices in pictures, I thought it was expensive. Burger buns were slightly over cooked. Tray of large curry chip wasn't full and cost 6.20. | Heard rave reviews about this chipper so IGÇÖm hoping we just got them on an off day! Chips werenGÇÖt great and battered sausage was dark meat with thick chewy batter. My parents got the fish and it looked good, nice large piece hopefully they used a different type of batter otherwise it would be chewy too. The fish is the only reason for 3 stars otherwise based on the chips and batteries sausage it would be a 1 star unfortunately. Again I have heard really good things so still give them a try and see for yourself. Staff were very pleasant and friendly! | Super sound staff. Their chips are to die for and ye can never go wrong with a powers pizza =ƒìò | I am so drunk right now and was in desperate need of carbs and meat. I have never eaten anything quite so beautiful as this. The food coma will be the stuff of legend. Meat feast pizza and a chicken burger will be a must have every time I down my third fireball.
Brooklyn Restaurant Tramore is a Mexican restaurant in Waterford. Customer reviews say: We went for a long drive to try this restaurant. The ambience is really nice as this is near the beach. It's relaxing to eat here. I love how they are presenting their cocktails and plating food. We were able to try their lunch menu. Set menu is available though from 4pm. The food is ok but i am expecting more from the seafood meals. Though overall service and ambience is really great. If we'll go back i'll try other specials. | The view was spectacular. The surface was a little bit slow but I think that was due to a staffing issue. The drinks were fun and unique, and we went to this place because it was recommended to us. We did not get the pizza and I think that's where we are went wrong. | Food was absolutely incredible, the Christmas menu is exceptional.. especially the crostini starter. Chicken wings were very nice. The seafood pie, that is now an option on their updated menu, was lovely. Finished off with the winter berry crumbleGÇª an overall very enjoyable experience once again. Staff were very attentive as always. | Well this restaurant is very interesting and wonderful. The atmosphere was relaxing and magical. I am sure it was because of the Christmas decorations, but the restaurant itself is also very pretty. Unfortunately, at the time, there were many people, so it was hard to move because the place is small. The food was delicious, but the mulled wine was bad, but I am from a country that makes a lot of wine, and I know wine well. Unfortunately in Ireland is not good with wine. But any way, it was better than I thought it would be. The staff were very friendly and kind. +there are toilets | It is just on the seaside..with amazing viewsG¥ñn+ÅG¥ñn+Å. It was too crowded that day but still the service was too quickG¥ñn+ÅG¥ñn+Å. Loved the food . The pizza was too hot and thin crust was perfect. The beer battered fish was so fresh and tasty. Highly recommend. Value for money.G¥ñn+ÅG¥ñn+Å
Phoenix Yard Market is a Mexican restaurant in Waterford. Customer reviews say: The food was DELICOUS and there were many options for vegetarians and vegans =ƒÿì we got vegan hotdogs and wedges and they were so tasty =ƒî¡=ƒìƒ=ƒæîG¥ñn+Å | Loved the Atmosphere & Food | Antichi Sapori!!! Authentic Italian food, served with authentic smiles at great value for money. Had the cabonara... 10/10 | No stars for me. Long red hair in my burrito from chingon. Soggy tasteless with fatty beef. Absolutely disgusting. Back to La Vida Loca for me. | Great food, handy location
Amigo is a Mexican restaurant in Waterford. Customer reviews say: I ordered a double taco, the double only had bread, one spoon of meat and 5 euros is very expensive, I wasn't full and it wasn't tasty! You can eat better in another place for 5 euros | Horrible. We couldnGÇÖt even eat it so we left it all behind. Chicken wasnGÇÖt near hot enough didnGÇÖt want to get sick from it. Everything had zero flavour. We came here since Cassie Stokes did a promo for it and I seriously donGÇÖt know why she stood over this place.. | The corn gluten free 6 inch tacos were delicious. Service was quick. The interior seating was comfortable. Overall, it's good value for money. | Ordered at 9pm last night, at 10pm it was finally on the way. The driver didn't move for about 10 minutes so I sent a message on Uber. He then called me to say he's stuck with two orders. The restaurant was closing and had cleaned up and said they aren't making the orders. Told the driver to mark them as collected. He was then stuck with the orders on his app and couldn't do more orders (driver is top rated). Shameful that the restaurant didn't even call themselves. Not my first incident here over customer service ridiculous carry on. Back to Changaro for the customer service.  Update: As much as I'd hate to drag a family business, the way you treat customers here is disgusting. I posted this a month ago, got a reply fairly quick but can now see they've edited their response one day ago. Horrible to be blaming Uber and the drivers when they're the only ones who made contact, you were probably home and all by then. The food was not late, it was refused to be made. Driver was in an awful panic. Hilarious reading all the reviews, but what's even funnier is the we checked CCTV response.. had an issue like this before, claimed staff aka family "didn't do it" and insisted I was lying about an order being wrong. Told them not to bother checking but they called back to say the camera showed driver taking wrong order which was a lie since rest of order was perfect. (Dietary requirements meant the wrong one couldn't be eaten). But I think the most APPALLING part is the absolute audacity and rudeness of the owner replies. Might be " in the business years " as they say, but clearly have learnt zero customer service... Won't be wasting more time on this review or this place=ƒñæ | Great fresh food, really lovely staff, and a nice-looking place. Easily best burritos in Waterford!
Unbeetable Food is a Mexican restaurant in Waterford. Customer reviews say: Is this the healthiest food truck in Ireland? Delicious, fresh and bright food that really has the locals coming back for more. Think pho, tandoori chicken burger, nutty green salad, bagels | The food here is absolutely unbelievable. The freshest and tastiest. The closest thing to Vietnamese fresh noodles with leaves and Spices. Highly recommend! 100% stop here if you are going to Tramore. | Salads are the best or the best one I ever had. Staffs are fantastic. Menu will change every day. Coconut curry with rice noodles was good | Really delicious! I ordered French onion sourdough bread sandwiches and Roasted beetroot and hazelnut salad. IGÇÖm so happy to find this place. Totally coming back soon. | Honestly one of the best and refreshing menu set by the owners. A must go place when in Tramore/ Waterford. Can dine in or takeaway. The flavours are amazing and very fresh ingredients used.
Bun Cha Journey is a Mexican restaurant in Waterford. Customer reviews say: Really cool interior, super vietnam =ƒç+=ƒç¦ themed.  The B+¦n Chß¦ú portion was huge, IGÇÖve been to Vietnam before but youGÇÖd never get a portion this big haha I guess the portions have been adjusted for the Irish appetite. It was really delicious nonetheless, very authentic and fresh.  I also got the vietnamese coffee and it was super yummy. IGÇÖd definitely recommend coming here especially if youGÇÖre just back from a holiday in VN like me and craving some vietnamese food again! | Absolutely loved this Vietnamese restaurant! The pho soup, bao buns, and dumplings were all incredibly tasty GÇö full of flavor and beautifully cooked. The staff were super friendly and welcoming, making the whole experience even better. Prices are very reasonable for the quality you get. Highly recommend this place if youGÇÖre looking for delicious Vietnamese food and great service! | I loved their phß+ƒ! IGÇÖve been searching for good Vietnamese spots, and I think I finally found one today. IGÇÖve never been to Vietnam, so I canGÇÖt compare it to the real thing, but the broth here was deliciousGÇöI finished every drop. Highly recommended if youGÇÖre visiting Waterford town. | Bun Cha Journey is a fantastic spot for authentic Vietnamese food. The bun cha is rich, smoky, and perfectly balanced with fresh herbs and light, flavourful dipping sauce. Portions are generous, ingredients taste fresh, and the presentation is spot on. Friendly service and a relaxed atmosphere make it an easy place to return to. Highly recommended for anyone craving real Vietnamese flavours. | I try bun cha and bao cha. It's so good that I forget to take picture. It's very healthy with a lot of veggie. Their BBQ is good with a sweet taste. Totally recommend to anyone wants to try new food
La Vida Loca is a Mexican restaurant in Waterford. Customer reviews say: Amazing food truck!!! I went there with my Colombian friend and she was so surprised on how good the food was. Great quality, nice staff, variety of options. 100% recommended stopping by and trying it. | The food was delicious, made with great quality ingredients, and the portion sizes were generous for the price. I visited with friends, and we all agreed it was a great experience.

Changarro is a Mexican restaurant in Waterford. Customer reviews say: Delicious food, heavily recommend the rancheros burrito and all kinds of nachos. The staff are very friendly (Mind, the food in the photos is half-eaten; because of course we had to dig in on the spot) | An excellent place with wonderful,fresh food!WeGÇÖre really glad we found it.We ordered the pork burrito, beef bowl,and chicken chimichangas -everything was perfectly spicy and delicious.The total was Gé¼29.35,and we truly enjoyed every bite.Highly recommend this place!The lady at the counter was very kind and welcoming G¥ñn+Å | St. Patrick's Day after working I met part of my family there. We are Mexicans and is difficult for us to find Mexican food =ƒÑæ.I asked for a Nachos bowl, and it was delicious. The service and people are very friendly...some of them are Mexicans. Highly recommend. | Staff super friendly and really welcoming. Made the dining experience worthwhile! The burritos were tasty but not amazing. Something was missing but I can't put my finger on it :/ | I always buy Nacho dessert here and staff never disappoints. The place is always clean and tidy with tasty food and reasonable prices. Very cosy atmosphere.
Poquito is a Mexican restaurant in Waterford. Customer reviews say: We went there to get brunch after training and it really hit the spot. The breakfast burrito is amazing and so satisfying. The regular burrito with pulled pork was also really good. They do not skimp on the portions at all and give you a little hot sauce on the side.  The staff was super friendly and offered us water. Also they are super dog friendly and had treats and a water bowl.  We also bought some of their hot sauces. They have a wide variety of different flavours for not very much money and I highly recommend the taster set as a gift for any hot sauce lover.  Overall 10/10 :)) | The birria broth that comes with the birria tacos is outstanding, even more so when you dump the coriander and onion that comes on the side in to it. The tacoGÇÖs themselves are delicious, tender beef with a nice, umami flavour.  Very friendly staff. A nice selection of Mexican soft drinks set in a lovely part of the world. | Had my eye on this place a while but never got a chance to try it,  Til tonight. After a couple quiet pints in the Vic I walked out into an early contender for the coldest night of the year. I looked left and like a moth to a flame I wandered towards the welcoming light of Poquito. The takeaway offerings of Tramore has expanded greatly in recent years but I'd been holding out for a nice mexican place. My favourite cuisine. And my standards are not low.  I walked into a colourful and charming tacoterie, clean and well lit where two friendly staff members welcomed me with a warm greeting and we shared commiserations on the cold outside the door.  I ordered a chilli beef burrito.  At this point I expected it would be good and it only exceeded this expectation. It's the real deal. Flavourful and delicately prepared.  Currently well fed and grateful and will be back soon for more. | Really delicious food - great to have some authentic Texmex/Mexican in Tramore. Highly recommend the chorizo breakfast burrito | We happened to be staying close by on a wknd in Mt Congrieve. I had been researching places to eat and this caught my eye.  Mexican is my favourite type of cuisine so I have high expectations.  Fresh, tasty, home made sauces, lots of different options and is everything you'd want from a lovely meal! I'll definitely be back to try more of the menu!
The Sweep Bar is a Mexican restaurant in Waterford. Customer reviews say: Wonderful food and service, and just such a cozy place! I had the best monkfish in my life here! Highly recommend. | Food Very tasty =ƒÿï Price reasonable =ƒæì Very busy Lovely atmosphere Highly recommend =ƒæî =ƒæì | This pub is popular, so we had to wait in line. After that, everything was great, spacious place for two, fast order fulfillment and smiling, knowledgeable staff. A real pleasure from visiting! | Sweep Bar Kilmeaden Located on the N25 in Kilmeaden just outside Waterford City. Plenty of parking is available outside, including designated disabled spaces. , and the entire premises is wheelchair accessible. A Traditional Irish Pub. It retains its traditional feel with thatched roof and traditional decor.inside without feeling like a theme pub. Very comfortably furnished, and although I have only ever really been here for food and not drinks, I would imagine that it is a comfortable bar for a drink after the food service has finished. The service here is good. The staff are quick and efficient, in getting you seated, menus handed out, taking orders and bussing tables. The Sweep can get very busy at peak times, a testament to their great food offering. Good quality ingredients and plentiful, representing good value for money. There is a great selection of menu items for both breakfast and lunch. Breakfast offers the traditional fry, but also, pancakes,scrambled eggs, ommlettes, scones. Something for everyone (except those that like Granola) Their lunch offering is as varied with the traditional fayre of a roast dinner to steak sandwiches , and seafood options, with daily specials. The prices here are average, but you do get a good meal for your money, so definitely good value here. | Popped into here on 2nd January with family for lunch. Had the southern style chicken burger, which was outstanding. Thick juicy chicken breast with BBQ sauce, cheese, bacon and frizze onions, served with home made chips. Flavour was fantastic and the frizze onions added a nice bit of crunch. Washed down with a perfect pint of Guinness. Service was faultless and staff were friendly, polite and welcoming, will visit again.
